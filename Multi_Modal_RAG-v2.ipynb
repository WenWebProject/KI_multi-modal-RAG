Further details regarding the specific diseases and mechanisms studied are not provided in this excerpt, but the article likely delves into the molecular and cellular aspects of AKAP1's function within the cardiovascular system. This suggests a focus on understanding the protein's impact at a fundamental biological level.\n",
      "This abstract focuses on A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are significant signaling molecules, particularly within mitochondria. Research suggests a connection between AKAP function and the development of cardiovascular diseases. The keywords indicate the study likely investigates how AKAPs influence signaling pathways related to heart health. Understanding these mechanisms could offer new insights into preventing or treating cardiovascular issues. The research likely explores the role of AKAPs in mitochondrial signaling within the cardiovascular system.\n",
      "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) regulate PKA signaling networks, and AKAP1 specifically protects the heart. This review focuses on AKAP1, detailing its different forms, structural features, and how it interacts with other proteins. It explores the connection between AKAP1 and cardiac hypertrophy – an enlargement of the heart. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AKAP1’s role in heart health at a molecular level, from its sequence to its function. Ultimately, it seeks to clarify how AKAP1 contributes to protecting against heart disease.\n",
      "This text highlights a connection between hypoxia (low oxygen), myocardial infarction (heart attack), and dysfunction of endothelial cells – cells lining blood vessels. The research suggests that a protein called AKAP1 may be a potential target for new cardiovascular therapies. Essentially, hypoxia and heart attacks seem to negatively impact endothelial cell function, and AKAP1 could offer a way to counteract these effects. This implies AKAP1 plays a role in maintaining healthy heart function, particularly under stressful conditions like oxygen deprivation. Further investigation into AKAP1 could lead to treatments aimed at protecting the heart and blood vessels.\n",
      "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) function like conductors of an orchestra in cellular signaling. They organize signaling molecules—effectors, enzymes, receptors, and mRNA—in specific locations within the cell. This precise placement optimizes signaling events and helps maintain cellular homeostasis. Essentially, AKAPs don't directly activate signals, but rather ensure the right components are in the right place at the right time for effective communication. They are critical for coordinated and efficient signal transduction, much like a conductor is for a symphony.\n",
      "AKAPs are scaffold proteins that interact with protein kinase A (PKA). They share a common feature: binding to PKA regulatory subunits through an amphipathic alpha-helix. However, AKAPs exhibit structural diversity. Crucially, AKAPs also possess domains that anchor them – and the PKA complexes they bind – to specific locations within cells (subcellular organelles). This anchoring function creates “transducesome” complexes. Essentially, AKAPs localize PKA signaling to precise sites within the cell.\n",
      "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) are crucial for regulating cAMP signal transduction pathways. They strategically position key enzymes and factors – including GPCRs, adenylyl cyclase, and various phosphatases – near their downstream targets. This proximity enables precise control of signaling processes. AKAPs interact with cellular structures like the plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and mitochondria. They are essential for efficient and accurate cAMP-dependent signaling within the cell. Essentially, AKAPs act as scaffolding proteins, organizing the components needed for effective signal transduction.\n",
      "AKAPs are crucial components of cAMP signaling, enhancing its efficiency and integrating it with other cellular pathways. They form complexes with various proteins including ion channels, kinases (PKD, ERK1/2, GSK3B), and small GTP-binding proteins. This complex formation allows AKAPs to regulate diverse cellular events beyond just cAMP signaling. Consequently, AKAPs play a key role in coordinating signaling crosstalk within the cell. Their multi-functional nature highlights their importance in cellular communication and regulation.\n",

      "The cardiovascular system—comprising the heart, blood, and blood vessels—is the body’s transport network. It delivers oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body. Maintaining its homeostatic functions is crucial for overall health. Disruptions to this system can lead to a wide range of diseases. These include conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. More severe consequences can be heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, cardiovascular health is essential for preventing acute, chronic, and potentially fatal illnesses.\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally and are increasing, particularly in developing countries, despite being largely preventable. Current therapeutic options specifically targeting the *causes* of CVD, like hypertension and heart failure, are limited. Recent research highlights the importance of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) which are expressed in the heart and play key roles in the cardiovascular system. Further investigation into AKAP proteins may offer new avenues for CVD treatment.\n",
      "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) are implicated in both normal heart function and cardiovascular disease (CVD). They play a role in regulating various physiological processes within the heart. However, their involvement also extends to pathological conditions contributing to CVD development. This dual role suggests AKAPs could be valuable targets for new CVD therapies. Research indicates manipulating AKAP activity may offer a therapeutic avenue for treating heart conditions. Further investigation into AKAPs is warranted to explore their full potential in CVD treatment.\n",
      "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) play a role in regulating cardiovascular function. These proteins don't possess catalytic activity themselves, but they spatially organize protein kinases, notably Protein Kinase A (PKA), near their substrates. This localization is crucial for efficient and specific signaling within heart cells. AKAPs influence various cardiovascular processes including heart rate, contractility, and vascular tone. Different AKAP isoforms are expressed in distinct cardiac compartments, suggesting specialized roles. Disruptions in AKAP expression or function are linked to cardiovascular diseases like heart failure and arrhythmias. Research indicates AKAPs are potential therapeutic targets for these conditions. Further investigation is ongoing to fully understand the complex interplay between AKAPs and cardiovascular health. \n",
      "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) are key regulators in heart and blood vessel cells. They control the location and timing of cAMP signaling, impacting crucial heart functions. These functions include calcium cycling, heart muscle contraction, and the length of electrical signals in the heart. AKAPs also play a role in heart disease processes like irregular heartbeats, enlarged heart muscle, and heart failure. Furthermore, they are involved in how the heart adapts to low oxygen levels. Essentially, AKAPs coordinate signaling to maintain normal heart function and respond to stress. \n",
      "cAMP acts as a key messenger in heart cells, activating PKA to regulate both contraction and relaxation. This process influences critical functions like heart rate via HCN channels. Additionally, cAMP activates Epac proteins involved in calcium management and cardiac growth (hypertrophy). Rac1 is identified as another downstream effector of cAMP, suggesting a complex regulatory network within the heart. These pathways demonstrate cAMP's central role in cardiac function and adaptation.\n",
      "Here's a concise summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "This text describes the regulation of cAMP signaling within cells. Adenylyl cyclase produces cAMP, while phosphodiesterase (PDE) breaks it down. These two processes control both the *amount* of cAMP present and *where* the cAMP signal is active. cAMP signaling is important for maintaining the integrity of microvascular endothelial barriers, potentially through activation of Epacl/Rap1. Essentially, the balance between cAMP production and degradation fine-tunes cellular responses.\n",
      "Fine-tuning within AKAP complexes is crucial for integrating signaling molecules. This integration significantly impacts and helps maintain proper heart function. The close proximity of these molecules within the complexes allows for efficient communication and regulation. This process is essential for the heart's overall performance and health, as highlighted by research [25]. Essentially, AKAP complexes act as organizational hubs for signaling, optimizing cardiac function.\n",
      "AKAPs were originally named based on their size observed in SDS-PAGE. However, to avoid confusion with splice variants and cross-species homologs, they’ve been reclassified as AKAP1 through AKAP14 by the HGNG. This new nomenclature system provides a more organized and consistent naming convention for these important proteins. The reclassification aims to clarify distinctions between different forms of the same AKAP gene. This change reflects a more modern understanding of AKAP genetics and evolution. You can find more information on this at http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/AKAP.\n",
      "Recent reviews highlight the role of several A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in protecting heart muscle cells. Specifically, AKAP1, AKAP5, AKAP6, AKAP7, AKAP9, AKAP10, AKAP12, and AKAP13 have been discussed for their cardioprotective functions. These AKAPs—also known by alternative names like D-AKAP1, AKAP79/150, and Gravin—are key players in heart tissue. Research, as cited in references [7, 10, 11, 25], focuses on understanding how these proteins contribute to cardiomyocyte health. This suggests AKAPs are promising targets for therapies aimed at preventing heart damage.\n",
      "This text highlights differing expression levels of AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) within human heart muscle, based on data from the Human Protein Atlas. The article will primarily focus on AKAP1, a cardiac-enriched anchoring protein that has received limited research attention. Specifically, the research will cover AKAP1’s gene and protein sequence, spatial structure, and its role within the transducesome complex. This suggests a need for further investigation into AKAP1's function in the heart.\n",
      "This excerpt from the *Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology* focuses on A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1). Research indicates AKAP1 plays protective roles within both mitochondria and the cardiovascular system. The excerpt specifically introduces an overview of AKAP1, detailing its sequence, structure, and functions related to mitochondria. It further notes the existence of AKAP1 splice variants and their differing locations within cells. This suggests AKAP1’s function may vary depending on its specific form and cellular placement.\n",
      "AKAP1 is a group of proteins that anchors Protein Kinase A (PKA) and other proteins to the outer membrane of mitochondria. It’s also known as D-AKAP1 due to its ability to bind both type I and type II PKA regulatory subunits. Different isoforms exist across species, including AKAP121 (mouse/rat), AKAP149 (human), and S-AKAP84 (sperm). AKAP1 transcripts are found widely throughout the body. Essentially, AKAP1 functions as a key organizational protein for PKA signaling at the mitochondrial level.\n",
      "AKAP1 (A-kinase anchoring protein 1) is a protein widely expressed across numerous human tissues. Specifically, it’s found in the heart and testis, and a total of 27 tissues according to available data from NCBI and ProteinAtlas. This broad expression suggests AKAP1 plays a fundamental role in various cellular processes throughout the body. AKAP1 functions to localize protein kinase A (PKA) to specific locations within the cell. This localization is crucial for regulating PKA-mediated signaling pathways. Its widespread tissue distribution indicates involvement in diverse physiological functions, potentially including muscle contraction, hormone signaling, and neuronal activity. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific roles of AKAP1 in each tissue.\n",
      "The AKAP1 gene produces diverse protein transcripts through alternative splicing. Full-length AKAP1 proteins contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence, a PKA binding motif, a KH domain for RNA binding, and a Tudor domain. A shorter variant, S-AKAP84, lacks the KH and Tudor domains. S-AKAP84 is primarily found in male germ cells and exhibits selective targeting. These variations suggest AKAP1 plays diverse roles depending on the specific protein isoform expressed.\n",
      "This text discusses the unexpected localization of an AKAP1 N1 variant to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mouse liver cells, rather than the expected mitochondria. The variant contains an additional 33 amino acids due to alternative splicing. A specific negatively charged aspartic acid (Asp*) within these extra residues is crucial. This residue redirects the protein’s targeting signal, causing it to localize to both smooth and rough ER instead of the mitochondria. This demonstrates how a single amino acid change can alter protein localization. The original signal typically targets proteins to the mitochondrial sheath in the sperm middle piece.\n",
      "AKAP1 contains a PKA binding domain, crucial for its function as an A-kinase anchoring protein. This domain specifically interacts with Protein Kinase A (PKA), localizing it to specific cellular locations. This localization is vital for regulating PKA's activity and downstream signaling pathways. The PKA binding domain within AKAP1 is a conserved sequence motif. It allows AKAP1 to scaffold PKA and other signaling molecules, forming signaling complexes. This ensures efficient and targeted phosphorylation events. Variations in this domain can affect the strength and specificity of PKA interaction. Ultimately, the PKA binding domain is central to AKAP1’s role in cellular regulation. \n",
      "Protein Kinase A (PKA) exists as two holoenzyme types: type I (RI subunits) and type II (RII subunits). AKAP1 uniquely binds both RI and RII, showing a preference for RII. Most AKAPs favor RII subunit dimers, leading to the term \"RII-binding domain\" (RIIBD) for the PKA binding domain. This RIIBD is a conserved 14-18 amino acid fragment. Despite sequence diversity, it consistently forms a conserved amphipathic alpha-helix. This suggests a common structural element underlies PKA binding across different AKAPs.\n",
      "AKAP proteins share a common structural feature: interaction with the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain of Protein Kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunits. This interaction is visually represented in Figure 2A. This suggests a conserved mechanism for AKAP function involving PKA regulation. The D/D domain is crucial for PKA’s localization and activity. Therefore, AKAPs likely play a role in spatially and temporally controlling PKA signaling. This interaction is supported by reference [40].\n",
      "AKAP proteins bind to Protein Kinase A (PKA) via a conserved motif: [AVLISE]-X-X-[AVLIF]-[AVLI]-X-X-[AVLI]-[AVLIF]-X-X-[AVLISE]. AKAP1 isoforms exhibit similar nonpolar residue arrangements within this PKA binding domain. Researchers created peptides – Rl-anchoring disruptors (RIAD) and Rll-preferring AKAP-IS – to interfere with AKAP-PKA interactions. These artificial peptides demonstrate improved affinity and specificity compared to naturally occurring AKAP RIIBDs. This suggests a potential for targeted disruption of the AKAP-PKA signaling pathway.\n",
      "This text describes a mechanism by which a substance interferes with Protein Kinase A (PKA) function. Specifically, it competitively binds to the PKA regulatory (R) dimer. This binding causes PKA to detach or \"dislocate,\" disrupting its normal activity. Consequently, the downstream phosphorylation events that PKA usually triggers are also disturbed. Essentially, this substance acts as an inhibitor of PKA signaling, potentially impacting cellular processes regulated by this kinase. The citation [43] indicates this information is sourced from a research study.\n",
      "AKAP121 and AKAP149 proteins uniquely contain a K homology (KH) domain. This KH domain binds to AU-rich RNAs and single-strand DNA. Binding relies on a specific secondary structure – B1-a1-a2-B2-B3-a3 – and a GXXG loop. An intact hydrophobic groove within the KH domain is crucial for RNA binding. These findings were determined through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements.\n",
      "This text refers to Table 1 from a research article by W. Marin published in the *Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology* in 2020. The study focuses on the KH domain – a protein domain – found within AKAP149 in humans and AKAP121 in mice and rats. The research likely compares and contrasts this KH domain across these species. The article appears in volume 138 of the journal, specifically on pages 99-109. Further details regarding the findings would be found within the table itself and the surrounding text of the publication.\n",

Staining intensity is categorized as “Not detected”, “Low”, “Medium”, or “High”. mRNA levels are quantified using TPM and RPKM values. The study aims to map AKAP expression across different cell types within the heart. This information is crucial for understanding AKAP function and potential roles in cardiac physiology and disease.

      "This text describes the functional domains of the AKAP121 protein in mice. AKAP121 is 857 amino acids long and contains several key binding motifs. These include four tubulin binding motifs, PP1 and PP4 binding domains, and sites for PKA RII binding. It also possesses a Tudor domain and two mitochondrial targeting sequences, located at residues 301-763 and 355-376. A leucine-rich motif is present between residues 310-338.

Essentially, the figure visually maps and compares the structural components of AKAP1 across species.\n",
      "AKAP149 contains a highly conserved KH domain with a PKA phosphorylation site (Ser®°). Phosphorylation of this site by co-anchored PKA prevents interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This promotes binding to mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins. Additionally, modifications with NH (X = B-Ala) strongly inhibit the anchoring function of the AKAP121 complex. The text also mentions a tubulin-binding motif within AKAP proteins.\n",
      "The AKAP1 Tudor domain has a unique barrel-like structure formed by five beta-sheets. This domain specifically recognizes arginine molecules with symmetrical dimethylation. It also exhibits weak RNase activity, meaning it can degrade RNA to a limited extent. Consequently, the KH-Tudor domain plays a role in controlling RNA—specifically, its stability, location within the cell, and translation into proteins. Essentially, it regulates what happens to the RNA it binds.\n",
      "AKAP149, AKAP121, and S-AKAP84 share a common tubulin-binding motif (residues 10-25) within their N-terminal MT motif (1-30 amino acids). This motif is conserved and enables interaction with both tubulin polymers and soluble microtubules. These AKAP1 scaffolds are capable of assembling diverse mRNA and protein partners. They also contain a mitochondrial targeting motif.\n",
      "The first 30 amino acids of AKAP1 function as a mitochondrial targeting (MT) motif, crucial for attaching the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This motif’s sequence and predicted structure closely resemble the targeting domain of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cb5r), enabling membrane insertion. Essentially, AKAP1 utilizes a similar mechanism to cb5r to localize within the mitochondria. This suggests a conserved strategy for protein targeting to the mitochondrial outer membrane. The MT motif is therefore essential for AKAP1’s function and localization.\n",
      "This text describes a mitochondrial targeting signal found in proteins, specifically referencing the AKAP121 protein. The signal requires a hydrophobic alpha-helix followed by positively charged amino acids. This combination is both necessary and sufficient for directing a protein to the mitochondria. An artificial peptide mimicking this motif (Ac-'XKKPLALPGMLALLGWWWEFSRKKX~°) has been created, demonstrating the importance of this sequence for mitochondrial localization. This suggests the sequence can be used to target proteins to the mitochondria artificially.\n",
      "AKAP1 protein function is determined by its amino acid sequence and resulting spatial configuration. It acts as a scaffold, recruiting signaling enzymes and mRNAs to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This recruitment forms a “transduceosome” complex. This complex organizes and directs various signaling pathways. Essentially, AKAP1 orchestrates cellular signaling by bringing key components together at a specific location – the mitochondria. This allows for efficient and targeted signal transduction. \n",
      "AKAP1 is a scaffolding protein that localizes both PKA RI and RII to the outer mitochondrial membrane. This positioning allows AKAP1 to mediate cellular responses to cAMP signaling via PKA activation. AKAP1 also binds to cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that degrades cAMP and thus regulates the strength of cAMP signaling. The protein contains specific domains for binding PKA R subunits, structured as amphipathic alpha-helices, and can interact with both PKA RII dimers and the D/D domain of PKA RII. This suggests AKAP1 plays a key role in spatially organizing and regulating PKA signaling at the mitochondria.\n",

Conversely, AKAP1 recruits calcineurin (CaN), which dephosphorylates Drp1 and reactivates its GTPase function. This reactivation by CaN leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. Essentially, AKAP1 acts as a molecular switch, balancing mitochondrial stability and fragmentation through opposing phosphorylation events on Drp1. This dual regulation influences cell fate by controlling mitochondrial health.\n",

      "AKAP1 localizes Protein Kinase A (PKA) to the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOM). This proximity allows PKA to phosphorylate mitochondrial substrates like NDUFS4 and cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Specifically, PKA phosphorylates Serine in NDUFS4, a component of complex I, activating it and increasing mitochondrial respiration. COX, the final enzyme in the respiratory chain, is also a target. This suggests AKAP1-mediated PKA localization plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial function through phosphorylation events.\n",
      "Mitochondrial respiration is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of COX subunits. PKA phosphorylates COX, increasing its sensitivity to ATP inhibition, thus *reducing* respiration. Conversely, calcium-induced dephosphorylation *increases* COX activity, boosting respiration, heat production (thermogenesis), and ATP synthesis. AKAP121 and PTPD1 facilitate Src tyrosine kinase localization to mitochondria. Src then phosphorylates COX, positively regulating its activity – a mechanism working in opposition to PKA. These processes demonstrate complex control of mitochondrial function via post-translational modifications of COX.\n",

This suggests the regulation is a documented scientific finding. Further context is needed to understand *what* is doing the regulating.\n",
      "AKAP1 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics—the balance between fusion and fission. These dynamics are crucial for maintaining healthy mitochondrial function and protecting cells from respiratory issues. AKAP1 achieves this regulation by bringing together kinases and phosphatases, controlling protein phosphorylation. Specifically, it fine-tunes the AKAP1-PKA-Drp signaling pathway, which directly impacts mitochondrial fission. Extended mitochondrial networks, facilitated by these dynamics, help maintain membrane potential and cellular health. Essentially, AKAP1 ensures proper mitochondrial function through precise control of fission and fusion processes.\n",
      "Mitochondrial fission is controlled by Drp1 and Fis1 proteins. Fis1 resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOM) and recruits Drp1 to fission sites. Drp1 utilizes GTP hydrolysis to fuel the fission process. Specifically, in heart muscle cells stimulated by isoproterenol, a signaling pathway activates PKA. PKA, anchored to the MOM by AKAP1, then phosphorylates Drp1 at a specific serine residue (Ser®*”). This phosphorylation event is crucial for regulating Drp1 activity and ultimately, mitochondrial fission.\n",
      "AKAP1 interacts with Drp1, a protein crucial for mitochondrial fission, and regulates its activity. Specifically, AKAP1 binding *inhibits* Drp1’s GTPase activity, potentially slowing down fission. Conversely, another AKAP1 partner, calcineurin (CaN), *promotes* Drp1 dephosphorylation, which encourages fission. Thus, AKAP1 appears to act as a central regulator, balancing fission through opposing interactions with Drp1 and calcineurin. This suggests a complex control mechanism for mitochondrial dynamics. These interactions are supported by research cited as [53].\n",

Essentially, AKAP121 facilitates this protective signaling pathway by transmitting cAMP-PKA signals to the mitochondria. This ultimately leads to BAD phosphorylation and inhibits apoptosis. Therefore, AKAP1 acts as a crucial regulator in preventing cell death through mitochondrial pathways.\n",

      "AKAP1 plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy, an enlargement of the heart. Studies show altered AKAP1 expression in hypertrophic hearts, suggesting it contributes to the disease process. Specifically, AKAP1 influences PKA signaling, a key pathway in cardiac growth and function. Reduced AKAP1 levels can lead to disrupted PKA localization and impaired cardiac contractility. Conversely, increased AKAP1 can also contribute to pathological hypertrophy depending on the context. Therefore, AKAP1 appears to be a modulator, not simply an activator or inhibitor, of hypertrophic signaling. Further research is needed to fully understand its complex role and potential as a therapeutic target.\n",
      "Cardiac hypertrophy—an enlargement of the heart—occurs both physiologically during fetal development and pathologically in response to stress like hypertension or myocardial infarction. While initially a compensatory mechanism, prolonged stress leads to detrimental changes in heart structure and function. These chronic changes ultimately contribute to heart failure, increasing risks of illness and death. The process involves complex intracellular signaling pathways that are currently being investigated. Essentially, the heart grows in response to demands, but sustained growth becomes harmful.\n",
      "The mechanisms regulating hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes are not fully understood. Current research indicates a partial understanding of these processes, as highlighted by references [33, 66, 67]. This suggests ongoing investigation is needed to fully elucidate the factors controlling cardiac muscle cell enlargement. Further study is crucial for developing potential therapies targeting cardiac hypertrophy.\n",
      "AKAPs are widely expressed in the heart and play a role in cardiac hypertrophy signaling. Specifically, AKAP-Lbc and mAKAP® regulate factors within these pathways. AKAP-Lbc forms a complex with kinases PKA, PKC, and PKD, as well as MEF2. Stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors activates PKA, PKC, and PKD within the AKAP-Lbc complex, initiating downstream signaling. This suggests AKAPs are key regulators of cardiac function and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\n",
      "This text discusses the molecular mechanisms driving cardiac hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart). Specifically, it focuses on how the protein AKAP6 (mAKAPB) acts as a central anchor within the nuclear envelope. AKAP6 brings together key players like CaN (calcineurin), ERK5 kinase, and the transcription factor NFATc3. ERK5 activation, stimulated by leukemia inhibitory factor, contributes to hypertrophy. Furthermore, phosphorylation and nuclear transport of HDAC5 also promote the transcription of genes involved in hypertrophy via MEF2. Essentially, AKAP6 organizes these proteins to regulate gene expression and drive cardiac growth.\n",
      "AKAP-Lbc and mAKAP proteins are crucial for healthy heart growth and survival. They support the adaptive response of cardiomyocytes to stress, preventing harmful cardiac remodeling. Specifically, these proteins influence the activity of NFATC3, a key regulator of genes involved in heart enlargement. Without AKAP-Lbc and mAKAP, cardiomyocytes are smaller, indicating impaired growth and potential vulnerability. These findings highlight their importance in the early stages of cardiac adaptation and overall heart health.\n",
      "AKAP121 plays a role in regulating heart muscle cell (cardiomyocyte) size. Reducing AKAP121 levels leads to increased cardiomyocyte size (hypertrophy), while increasing AKAP121 levels *reduces* cell size and protects against hypertrophy induced by adrenaline-like substances. This regulation occurs, at least in part, through the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. AKAP121 functions similarly to another protein, mAKAPB, in this pathway.  Furthermore, AKAP121 shares structural similarities with AKAP79, specifically in areas that bind to calcineurin (CaN).\n",
      "AKAP5 directly binds to CaN in mitochondria, while AKAP1 knockdown increases active CaN in heart muscle cells. CaN activates NFATc3, a transcription factor linked to cardiac hypertrophy. NFATc3 is inactive when phosphorylated and resides in the cell's cytoplasm. CaN dephosphorylates NFATc3, enabling its movement to the cell nucleus.

The study investigates how B-ARs influence cardiomyocyte genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy, specifically through the Akap1 protein and its impact on nuclear transcription. This suggests a link between B-AR signaling, Akap1, and the genetic changes driving heart enlargement.\n",
      "AKAP1 in cardiomyocytes regulates cardiac hypertrophy. Silencing AKAP1 leads to calcineurin (CaN) activation by releasing it from AKAP1 complexes. Activated CaN then moves NFATc3 into the nucleus, increasing the expression of genes that promote heart muscle growth (hypertrophy). This process is also influenced by β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP levels. Essentially, AKAP1 acts as a brake on hypertrophic signaling, and its removal triggers a pathway leading to heart muscle enlargement. This pathway involves a cascade of protein activity changes ultimately affecting gene expression.\n",
      "Activated PKA enters the nucleus and phosphorylates CREB, triggering Akap1 gene transcription. This process is typically initiated by stimulation of B-AR. However, excessive B-AR stimulation disrupts cAMP and PKA levels. These disruptions then lead to altered transcription of the Akap121 gene, initiated by CREB. Essentially, PKA regulates gene expression via CREB phosphorylation, and imbalances in signaling can affect this regulation.\n",
      "Pathological overloads can reduce beta-adrenergic receptor (B-AR) sensitivity and density, leading to desensitization and over-stimulation. This process downregulates B-AR signaling to adenylyl cyclase and reduces cAMP production. Research indicates that AKAP1 levels increase with rising cAMP, facilitated by B-AR-cAMP-PKA signaling. This activation also leads to phospho-CREBger133 accumulation. These changes are linked to hypertrophy and heart failure.\n",
      "This text discusses the potential link between Akap1, CREB (a nuclear transcription factor), and heart conditions like left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Researchers hypothesize Akap1 may be regulated by CREB. In a rat model of LVH, activation of B-AR desensitization *reduced* CREB phosphorylation.

      "HIF-1α is a key regulator of cellular response to low oxygen (hypoxia). It activates genes involved in blood vessel formation, red blood cell production, and energy metabolism. Normally, HIF-1α is broken down under normal oxygen levels due to hydroxylation by PHDs and subsequent degradation via the VHL complex and proteasome. This process ensures HIF-1α levels are low when oxygen is sufficient. Essentially, HIF-1α acts as an oxygen sensor, triggering responses only when oxygen is scarce.\n",
      "Under low oxygen (hypoxia), PHD proteins are blocked and marked for destruction by Siah2, an E3-ubiquitin ligase. Siah2 attaches ubiquitin molecules to PHD1 and PHD3, targeting them for breakdown by the proteasome. This destruction allows HIF-1α to build up, activating genes that respond to hypoxia. Consequently, cells shift from efficient oxygen-based metabolism to less efficient fermentation. This metabolic switch is a key adaptation to survive in low-oxygen environments. The process is supported by research in [5, 11, 78].\n",

      "Hypoxia leads to AKAP121 degradation via Siah2, disrupting mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes. This degradation reduces oxidative respiration and imbalances mitochondrial fission/fusion, ultimately causing cell death (apoptosis). AKAP121 normally regulates mitochondrial shape by inhibiting Drp1 through PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Drp1, interacting with Fis1, is crucial for mitochondrial fission. When AKAP121 is degraded, this fission process becomes dysregulated, contributing to the observed cellular damage. Essentially, hypoxia-induced AKAP121 loss destabilizes mitochondria and promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\n",
      "Hypoxia (low oxygen) triggers mitochondrial fission in heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). This process involves Drp1, a protein whose activity is increased under low oxygen conditions. Specifically, hypoxia reduces PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1, allowing it to interact with Fis1 and cause mitochondrial fragmentation. This increased fragmentation ultimately impairs mitochondrial function – the cell’s primary energy source – and leads to cardiomyocyte death. Essentially, low oxygen stresses the cell, causing its energy factories to break apart and fail, resulting in cell death.\n",
      "Myocardial ischemia—a lack of blood flow to the heart—causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular damage. A 2016 study showed that deleting the Akap1 gene worsened these effects, leading to abnormal mitochondria, increased mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy), and larger heart infarcts. Mitophagy is the process where cells selectively remove damaged mitochondria. Ischemia increases damaging molecules (ROS) from mitochondria, triggering cell death. Essentially, Akap1 appears to play a protective role against ischemia-induced heart damage by maintaining healthy mitochondria.\n",
      "Oxidatively damaged mitochondria are specifically removed by a process called mitophagy, a type of autophagy. This process involves the targeted delivery of these damaged mitochondria to autophagolysosomes for degradation. Mitophagy is crucial for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population and cellular function. This selective degradation prevents the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which can contribute to cellular stress and disease. The references [86-88] support this understanding of mitochondrial quality control.\n",

Specifically, mice lacking Akap1 showed higher levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial autophagy – PINK1, Parkin, and p62. The PINK1-Parkin pathway, activated in these mice, promotes mitochondrial fission over fusion. Essentially, the study demonstrates Akap1’s protective role against hyperoxia-induced lung injury by regulating mitochondrial health and autophagy.\n",

      "This text discusses the role of Akap1 in maintaining mitochondrial health during hyperoxia (high oxygen levels). The research indicates that Akap1 is important for regulating mitochondrial dynamics – the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission. Without Akap1, this balance is still maintained during hyperoxia, suggesting alternative mechanisms are at play. However, the specific molecular processes enabling this compensation in the absence of Akap1 remain unknown and require further investigation. Essentially, Akap1 contributes to mitochondrial health, but its absence doesn't completely disrupt function under these specific conditions.\n",

      "Endothelial cell dysfunction contributes to various cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis and hypertension. A key factor in maintaining healthy blood vessels is nitric oxide (NO), produced by endothelial cells. NO regulates blood pressure, vascular remodeling, and new blood vessel formation. The production of NO relies on an enzyme called endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which is activated by a protein kinase called Akt through phosphorylation. Essentially, proper NO production via eNOS is crucial for cardiovascular health, and disruptions in this process contribute to disease development.\n",

      "Mitochondria are key energy producers within endothelial cells (ECs) and also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) influence EC function by impacting redox balance. Specifically, mtROS boosts the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This activation involves the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Essentially, mitochondria play a crucial role in regulating EC behavior via ROS-mediated signaling pathways.\n",
      "Akt activity is modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a way that depends on both the amount of ROS and the time frame, influencing blood vessel relaxation and blood pressure. Mitochondrial A kinase anchoring proteins (MitoAKAPs), produced by the *Akap1* gene, play a key role in controlling mitochondrial function and the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS). These proteins manage cAMP signaling within mitochondria, impacting cellular processes in various cell types. Essentially, ROS influence blood pressure via Akt, while MitoAKAPs regulate ROS production *within* mitochondria themselves.\n",
      "Akap1 deficiency in endothelial cells increases hypoxia-induced mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death (apoptosis). This is consistent with prior research. Specifically, Akap1 deletion reduces levels of phosphorylated Akt and eNOS in blood vessels and heart cells. In Akap1 knockout mice, blood vessel relaxation is impaired and recovery after ischemia is delayed. These findings suggest Akap1 plays a crucial role in vascular health and function, potentially through regulating Akt and eNOS signaling.\n",
      "Akap1 regulates vascular functions in skeletal muscles, leading to new blood vessel formation (neovascularization) and increased blood pressure. This regulation occurs through the activation of a specific pathway: Akt-eNOS-NO. This pathway is crucial for endothelial function – the health of blood vessel linings. Essentially, Akap1 influences blood vessel behavior via this signaling cascade, impacting both muscle blood supply and overall blood pressure. The study referenced ([99]) provides evidence for this connection.\n",
      "Mitochondrial AKAP1 in endothelial cells (ECs) is crucial for regulating blood vessel relaxation and blood pressure. It achieves this by boosting eNOS phosphorylation via the P13K-Akt signaling pathway, which relies on nitric oxide (NO). This suggests mitochondrial AKAP1s (MitoAKAPs) could be promising targets for treating cardiovascular diseases. These diseases often stem from problems with how well the endothelium functions. Targeting MitoAKAPs may offer a new therapeutic approach to improve vascular health. Further research is needed to fully explore this potential.\n",
      "AKAP1 proteins are widely expressed and involved in various biological processes including fertility, neurological function, bone development, and obesity. Despite its broad roles, AKAP1's function in heart muscle cells (cardiac myocytes) has been poorly understood. Research has focused more on other AKAP proteins specifically found in the heart, like AKAP-Lbc and mAKAPB. This suggests a gap in knowledge regarding AKAP1's specific contribution to cardiac function. Further investigation is needed to clarify AKAP1’s role within the heart.\n",
      "AKAP188 is identified by the reference numbers 7, 25, 67, 69, 80, and 106-109. This likely indicates AKAP188 is a subject of study or a specific entity referenced in multiple publications. The numbers likely correspond to citations or entries within a larger dataset or bibliography. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the nature of AKAP188 – it could be a protein, gene, or other biological molecule. These references suggest AKAP188 has been investigated in several research studies. \n",
      "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) are crucial for cardiovascular health, each functioning in a distinct way. They work by binding to proteins beyond PKA and localizing them within the heart's cells. Understanding the specific functions of individual AKAP complexes and their signaling pathways is a promising new therapeutic approach. This strategy focuses on targeting specific cardiac disorders by manipulating these complexes. Characterizing these properties could lead to novel treatments for heart conditions.\n",
      "AKAP1, encoded by the *Akap1* gene, is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health and cell survival. This protein family is implicated in various cardiovascular events due to its role in mitochondrial dynamics. Specifically, alterations in mitochondrial dynamics are observed in conditions like cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and VSMC proliferation. Consequently, AKAP1 is believed to offer protection to the heart and evidence supports this cardioprotective function. Further research is ongoing to fully understand its mechanisms in cardiovascular health.\n",

      "Pathological overloads like hypertension or chronic stress desensitize Beta-adrenergic receptors (B-AR) in heart cells. This desensitization lowers cAMP levels and reduces Akap1 gene transcription, likely via CREB phosphorylation. Reduced AKAP1 releases CaN into the cell, leading to NFATc3 dephosphorylation. This ultimately initiates cardiac hypertrophy—an enlargement of the heart. Essentially, sustained stress on the heart triggers a signaling cascade that promotes its growth, potentially leading to dysfunction.\n",
      "This data point indicates gene expression levels. The values \"33\" and \"110\" likely represent the measured expression of a gene or genes – potentially across different conditions or time points. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the specific meaning (e.g., fold change, raw counts). Higher numbers generally suggest greater expression. This information is fundamental in understanding biological processes and responses to stimuli. Further analysis would require knowing *what* is being expressed and *under what conditions*. It's a quantitative measure used in fields like genomics and molecular biology.\n",
      "Under low oxygen (hypoxia), Siah2 degrades AKAP1, reducing mitochondrial respiration as a rapid survival adaptation. This degradation disrupts connections between AKAP1 and mitochondrial proteins NDUFS4 and COX. While initially protective against hypoxia-induced cell death, AKAP1 absence ultimately harms heart cells. Specifically, it disrupts mitochondrial dynamics, increases damaging ROS levels, and promotes cell death via interactions involving Drp1/Fis1 and BAD/W. Marin. Therefore, AKAP1 plays a complex role in cellular response to hypoxia, with both protective and detrimental effects.\n",
      "Akap1 deficiency in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia leads to increased mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. This deficiency also enhances cardiac mitophagy (mitochondrial autophagy) and apoptosis, ultimately increasing infarct size after myocardial infarction. Infarct size is a key determinant of post-ischemic remodeling of the heart. Therefore, AKAP1 proteins are crucial for cardiomyocyte survival and preventing adverse cardiac remodeling during ischemic events. Essentially, Akap1 protects the heart by maintaining mitochondrial health and preventing cell death following a heart attack.\n",
      "Endothelial cell dysfunction is a key feature of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension. This dysfunction is linked to imbalances in mitochondrial dynamics. Studies on Akap1 deficient mice show worsened mitochondrial health in endothelial cells. These mice also exhibited higher blood pressure, reduced blood vessel relaxation, and impaired recovery after reduced blood flow (ischemia). Therefore, Akap1 appears to play a crucial role in maintaining healthy endothelial function and cardiovascular health. Its deficiency contributes to several cardiovascular problems.\n",
      "Here's a concise summary of the text:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text suggests a decrease in stimulation is likely caused by reduced nitric oxide (NO) production. This reduction in NO synthesis stems from decreased activity of two proteins: Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Essentially, lower Akt activity leads to lower eNOS activity, ultimately resulting in less NO being produced and diminished stimulation. \n",
      "Akap1 influences cancer cell growth by regulating the mTOR complex, a key part of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This pathway also controls endothelial cell (EC) function in angiogenesis. Research suggests Akap1 may impact EC function through mitochondrial dynamics or the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Specifically, removing Akap1 leads to decreased phosphorylation and activation of eNOS, an important molecule for blood vessel function. Further investigation is needed to fully understand Akap1's role in ECs and angiogenesis.\n",
      "Akap1 likely influences endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation, potentially through a direct PKA-dependent mechanism. Previous research shows PKA directly phosphorylates eNOS and Akap1 participates in VEGF signaling via PKA-dependent VEGFRII phosphorylation. The reduced eNOS phosphorylation observed in Akap1-deficient endothelial cells could be due to this disrupted PKA pathway. Further investigation is needed to confirm this specific mechanism and its implications. This suggests a link between Akap1, PKA, and eNOS regulation in endothelial function.\n",
      "This text discusses the crucial role of calcium (Ca²⁺) in cellular function, particularly within mitochondria. AKAP1 anchors a protein (NCX3) that helps remove calcium from mitochondria, protecting neurons during low oxygen conditions (hypoxia).  Mitochondrial calcium regulation is also vital in cardiac muscle, maintaining overall cellular calcium balance. This intracellular calcium cycling directly regulates excitation-contraction coupling in the heart – the process linking electrical stimulation to muscle contraction. Essentially, proper calcium handling within cells, and specifically within mitochondria, is essential for both neuronal survival and heart function.\n",
      "This text discusses calcium handling in heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) and its role in excitation-contraction coupling. Current research primarily focuses on how the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) manages calcium and the interactions between related channels and pumps. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), like mAKAP, are known to regulate calcium release by anchoring proteins like NCX1 to the SR membrane. Emerging research is now investigating the transfer of calcium from the SR to mitochondria, suggesting a more complex calcium regulation system than previously understood. \n",
      "Mitochondria play a key role in efficient heart muscle function by linking excitation, contraction, and energy production. Their large size within heart cells suggests they actively participate in calcium handling, impacting both muscle contraction and ATP (energy) creation. Changes in mitochondrial calcium levels are seen in heart diseases affecting energy metabolism, but the exact *how* is still unknown. Research focuses on understanding how these mechanisms are regulated to improve cardiac function and address disease.\n",
      "Mitochondrial calcium (Ca²⁺) transport in heart muscle cells relies on two key mechanisms: influx via the MCU complex and efflux via the NCLX exchanger. NCLX is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane and moves Ca²⁺ from the mitochondrial matrix to the space between membranes. The outer mitochondrial membrane prevents passive Ca²⁺ movement, acting as a barrier. This suggests a regulated system for calcium handling within the mitochondria. Further research focuses on the role of proteins like AKAP1-anchored NCX3 in this process.\n",
      "OMM (outer mitochondrial membrane) regulates calcium efflux from mitochondria in neurons. This process likely extends to heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), facilitating calcium movement from between mitochondrial membranes to the cell's interior. Essentially, OMM controls how calcium leaves the mitochondria in both nerve and heart cells. This calcium expulsion is important for cellular function in both types of cells. The mechanism suggests a shared pathway for calcium regulation between neurons and cardiomyocytes.\n",
      "The AKAP1 complex plays a crucial role in cellular signaling. It relays cAMP-PKA signals from the cell membrane to the mitochondria. This process specifically localizes and organizes PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Essentially, AKAP1 helps control where and when phosphorylation happens within the cell, maintaining cellular function. This research appears in the *Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology*.\n",
      "AKAP1, highly expressed in the heart, plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial health and cell survival. Its dysfunction is linked to several cardiovascular diseases stemming from impaired mitochondrial function, including energy metabolism issues and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies indicate that AKAP1 absence contributes to cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction triggered by hypoxia, and problems with blood vessel and endothelial cell function. This suggests AKAP1 could be a promising target for therapies addressing cardiovascular diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n",
      "Further research is required to fully understand how AKAP1 impacts endothelial cell dysfunction. Specifically, the molecular mechanisms by which AKAP1 operates in these cells need clarification. Investigations should also explore whether the protective effects of the AKAP1 complex extend to other heart muscle disorders. A key area for study is AKAP1's potential role in regulating calcium movement within mitochondria during cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. This could reveal new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases.\n",

It explores the connection between AKAP1 and cardiac hypertrophy – an enlargement of the heart. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AKAP1’s role in heart health at a molecular level, from its sequence to its function. Ultimately, it seeks to clarify how AKAP1 contributes to protecting against heart disease.\n",
    "This text highlights a connection between hypoxia (low oxygen), myocardial infarction (heart attack), and dysfunction of endothelial cells – cells lining blood vessels. The research suggests that a protein called AKAP1 may be a potential target for new cardiovascular therapies. Essentially, hypoxia and heart attacks seem to negatively impact endothelial cell function, and AKAP1 could offer a way to counteract these effects.

    "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) function like conductors of an orchestra in cellular signaling. They organize signaling molecules—effectors, enzymes, receptors, and mRNA—in specific locations within the cell. This precise placement optimizes signaling events and helps maintain cellular homeostasis. Essentially, AKAPs don't directly activate signals, but rather ensure the right components are in the right place at the right time for effective communication. They are critical for coordinated and efficient signal transduction, much like a conductor is for a symphony.\n",
    "AKAPs are scaffold proteins that interact with protein kinase A (PKA). They share a common feature: binding to PKA regulatory subunits through an amphipathic alpha-helix. However, AKAPs exhibit structural diversity. Crucially, AKAPs also possess domains that anchor them – and the PKA complexes they bind – to specific locations within cells (subcellular organelles). This anchoring function creates “transducesome” complexes. Essentially, AKAPs localize PKA signaling to precise sites within the cell.\n",
    "AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) are crucial for regulating cAMP signal transduction pathways. They strategically position key enzymes and factors – including GPCRs, adenylyl cyclase, and various phosphatases – near their downstream targets. This proximity enables precise control of signaling processes. AKAPs interact with cellular structures like the plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and mitochondria. They are essential for efficient and accurate cAMP-dependent signaling within the cell. Essentially, AKAPs act as scaffolding proteins, organizing the components needed for effective signal transduction.\n",
    "AKAPs are crucial components of cAMP signaling, enhancing its efficiency and integrating it with other cellular pathways. They form complexes with various proteins including ion channels, kinases (PKD, ERK1/2, GSK3B), and small GTP-binding proteins. This complex formation allows AKAPs to regulate diverse cellular events beyond just cAMP signaling. Consequently, AKAPs play a key role in coordinating signaling crosstalk within the cell. Their multi-functional nature highlights their importance in cellular communication and regulation.\n",

    "The cardiovascular system—comprising the heart, blood, and blood vessels—is the body’s transport network. It delivers oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body. Maintaining its homeostatic functions is crucial for overall health. Disruptions to this system can lead to a wide range of diseases. These include conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. More severe consequences can be heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, cardiovascular health is essential for preventing acute, chronic, and potentially fatal illnesses.\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally and are increasing, particularly in developing countries, despite being largely preventable. Current therapeutic options specifically targeting the *causes* of CVD, like hypertension and heart failure, are limited. Recent research highlights the importance of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) which are expressed in the heart and play key roles in the cardiovascular system. Further investigation into AKAP proteins may offer new avenues for CVD treatment.\n",

They play a role in regulating various physiological processes within the heart. However, their involvement also extends to pathological conditions contributing to CVD development. This dual role suggests AKAPs could be valuable targets for new CVD therapies. Research indicates manipulating AKAP activity may offer a therapeutic avenue for treating heart conditions. Further investigation into AKAPs is warranted to explore their full potential in CVD treatment.\n",

This localization is crucial for efficient and specific signaling within heart cells. AKAPs influence various cardiovascular processes including heart rate, contractility, and vascular tone. Different AKAP isoforms are expressed in distinct cardiac compartments, suggesting specialized roles. Disruptions in AKAP expression or function are linked to cardiovascular diseases like heart failure and arrhythmias. Research indicates AKAPs are potential therapeutic targets for these conditions.

[114] Meyer *et al.* (2011) investigated how phosphorylation regulates the stability and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Their work, published in *Molecular and Cell Biology*, focuses on a PEST motif’s role in this process. [115] Cao *et al.* (2019) explored the function of calcium homeostasis within mitochondria in cardiac muscle cells, as reported in *Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics*. This research examines the role of mitochondrial calcium in heart function.\n",
    "These three research articles explore key aspects of calcium signaling and mitochondrial function in heart cells. Eisner et al. (2017) focuses on the fundamental process of excitation-contraction coupling, linking calcium to heart muscle contraction. De la Fuente & Sheu (2019) highlight the crucial communication between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, with calcium playing a central role. Finally, Yu & Pekkurnaz (2018) investigate how mitochondrial dynamics – fusion and fission – are regulated to maintain cellular energy balance. Collectively, these studies emphasize the interconnectedness of calcium handling, mitochondrial health, and cardiac function. They provide insights into the molecular mechanisms governing a healthy heart and potential targets for treating cardiac disease.'''"
