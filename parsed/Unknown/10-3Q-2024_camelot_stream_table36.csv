formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.,,
,We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue,
to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.,,
Privacy Matters,,
,We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations and we currently are party to a number of,
privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example there are ongoing investigations,,
and litigation in the U.S. and the EU including those relating to our collection and use of location information the,,
choices  we  offer  users  and  advertising  practices  which  could  result  in  significant  fines  judgments  and  product,,
changes.,,
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims,,
,We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that,
certain  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights. Adverse  results  in,,
these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or,,
orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have,,
to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss,,
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition the U.S. International Trade Commission ITC has,,
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC,,
action  can  result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing  infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  ecause  the  U.S.  is  an  important,,
market  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  including  preventing  us  from  importing,,
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.,,
,Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against,
certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  which  would  increase  our  costs  as  a  result  of  defending  such,,
claims  and  may  require  that  we  pay  significant  damages  if  there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  In,,
addition  our  customers  and  partners  may  discontinue  the  use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a,,
result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.,,
