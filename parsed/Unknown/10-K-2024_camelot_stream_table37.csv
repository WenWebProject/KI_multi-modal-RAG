revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these
markets  particularly  as  low-cost  mobile  devices  become  more  available.  This  trend  could  affect  our  revenues  as
developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
International  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  While  we  have  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program
designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues
and earnings.

The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins."
Revenues from cloud consumer subscriptions platforms and devices which may have differing characteristics
than our advertising revenues have grown over time and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding
our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins
on  our  advertising  revenues.  For  example  sales  of  our  devices  adversely  affect  our  consolidated  margins  due  to
pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.

servers network equipment and data centers to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives in

We  continue  to  face  an  evolving  regulatory  environment  and  we  are  subject  to  claims  lawsuits"
investigations  and  other  forms  of  potential  legal  liability  which  could  affect  our  business  practices  and
financial results.
Changes  in  social  political  economic  tax  and  regulatory  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  a  wide
range  of  topics  and  related  legal  matters  including  investigations  lawsuits  and  regulatory  actions  have  resulted  in
fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue our cost of doing business may
increase our products and services may become less useful our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer
certain  products  or  services  may  be  limited  and  we  may  need  to  change  our  business  models  and  operations  to
comply  with  evolving  regulatory  and  legal  matters.  For  additional  information  see  Part  I  Item  1A  Risk  Factors  and
