users  or  customers  or  the  monitoring  of  their  behavior  in  the  EU.  The  GDPR  creates  a  range  of  new  compliance,
obligations.,
,Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs and despite our
efforts governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to,
comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements we may incur substantial fines,
have to change our business practices and face reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our,
business. In particular serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide,
revenues. Fines of up to 2 of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations.,
,The  EU-U.S.  and  the  Swiss-U.S.  Privacy  Shield  frameworks  allow  U.S.  companies  that  self-certify  to  the  U.S.
Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the,
EU and Switzerland. Recently the CJEU ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism but,
upheld  Standard  Contractual  Clauses  as  a  valid  transfer  mechanism  provided  they  meet  certain  requirements.  The,
validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both Europe and,
the U.S. such as recent recommendations from the European Data Protection oard the invalidation of the EU-U.S.,
Privacy  Shield  and  potential  invalidation  of  other  data  transfer  mechanisms  which  could  have  a  significant  adverse,
impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA.,
,These developments create some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm
the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business.,
,We face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend
result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to,
use certain technologies in the future.,
,We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations
of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition patent-holding companies may frequently,
seek  to  generate  income  from  patents  they  have  obtained  by  bringing  claims  against  us.  As  we  have  grown  the,
number  of  intellectual  property  claims  against  us  has  increased  and  may  continue  to  increase  as  we  develop  new,
products services and technologies.,
,We  have  had  patent  copyright  trade  secret  and  trademark  infringement  lawsuits  filed  against  us  claiming  that
certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have,
also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International,
Trade Commission ITC for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or,
services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe,
the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary,
damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering,
certain features functionalities products or services. They may also cause us to change our business practices and,
require development of non-infringing products services or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for,
us and otherwise harm our business.,
,Many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to defend against
certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  and  in  some  cases  indemnify  them  for  certain  intellectual  property,
infringement  claims  against  them  which  could  result  in  increased  costs  for  defending  such  claims  or  significant,
damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the,
use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a  result  of  injunctions  or  otherwise  which  could  result  in  loss  of,
revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers,
when  obtainable  may  not  cover  all  damages  and  losses  suffered  by  us  and  our  customers  arising  from  intellectual,
property infringement claims. Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future,
agree  to  provide  indemnification  for  certain  potential  liabilities  including  those  associated  with  intellectual  property,
claims.,
,Regardless of their merits intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle.
To  the  extent  such  claims  are  successful  they  may  harm  our  business  including  our  product  and  service  offerings,
financial condition or operating results.,

term  stockholder  value  and  share  repurchases  could  increase  the  volatility  of  our  stock  prices  and  could,
diminish our cash reserves.,
