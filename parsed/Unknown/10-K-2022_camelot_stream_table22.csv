internet access providers to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In

blockages.  These  could  harm  existing  key  relationships  including  with  our  users  customers  advertisers  and/or

Risks Related to Laws Regulations and Policies
We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  new  existing  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide  that  could
harm our business and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue
to expand our business.
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects and our
introduction of new businesses products services and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws
and regulations. In recent years governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new
laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy particularly in the areas of data privacy and security competition
and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.
New or changing laws and regulations or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a
manner  inconsistent  with  our  practices  have  resulted  in  and  may  continue  to  result  in  less  useful  products  and
services  altered  business  practices  limited  ability  to  pursue  certain  business  models  or  offer  certain  products  and
services substantial costs and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:
"•
Competition  and  technology  platforms’  business  practices:  Laws  and  regulations 
focused  on 
large"
technology platforms including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union EU; regulations in South Korea
and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies fees and business model; as well as regulations under
consideration in a range of jurisdictions.
"•
Data privacy collection and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection processing"
and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data including privacy and data protection laws laws affecting the
processing of children's data as discussed further below data breach notification laws and laws limiting data
transfers including data localization laws.
"•
Copyright  and  other 
intellectual  property:  Copyright  and  related 
laws 
including 
the  EU  Directive  on"
Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions which may introduce new
licensing regimes increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms
or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.
"•
Content  moderation:  Various 
laws  covering  content  moderation  and 
removal  and 
related  disclosure"
obligations  such  as  the  EU's  Digital  Services Act  Florida’s  Senate  ill  7072  and  Texas’  House  ill  20  and
laws and proposed legislation in Singapore Australia and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure
to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and
algorithms  which  may  make  it  harder  for  services  like  Google  Search  and YouTube  to  detect  and  deal  with
low-quality deceptive or harmful content.
"•
Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers which could"
result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.
In  addition  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations  as  interpreted  by  the  courts
remain  uncertain  and  could  be  interpreted  in  ways  that  harm  our  business.  For  example  we  rely  on  statutory  safe
harbors like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency
Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe to protect against liability for various linking caching ranking
recommending and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us
and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S.
such  as  Gonzalez  v.  Google  EU  and  around  the  world  that  could  diminish  or  eliminate  safe  harbor  protection  for
websites and online platforms.
We  are  and  may  continue  to  be  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  investigations
enforcement actions consent orders and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm
our business reputation financial condition and operating results.
We  are  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  investigations  other  proceedings  and  consent
