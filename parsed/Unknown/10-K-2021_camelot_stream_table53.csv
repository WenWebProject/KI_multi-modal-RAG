uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To,

the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.,

estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure,
to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material.,
