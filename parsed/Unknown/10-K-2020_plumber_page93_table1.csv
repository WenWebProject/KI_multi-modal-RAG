,We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results.,
In 2019 we began a multi-year implementation of a new global ERP system which will replace much of our existing,,
core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of,,
financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team. The,,
implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The initial phase which included changes,,
to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting systems was completed during the third quarter of 2020.,,
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended,,
,,that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. However as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues we will change our,,
processes and procedures which in turn could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As,,
such changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over,,
financial reporting.,,
