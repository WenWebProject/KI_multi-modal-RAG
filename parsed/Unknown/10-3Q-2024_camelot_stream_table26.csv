operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.,,,,,,,,,
,For certain consolidated VIEs their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to,,,,,,,,
us. As of December 31 2023 and September 30 2024 assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these,,,,,,,,,
VIEs were 4.9 billion and 7.8 billion respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our,,,,,,,,,
Consolidated alance Sheets. As of December 31 2023 and September 30 2024 liabilities for which creditors only,,,,,,,,,

Unconsolidated VIEs,,,,,,,,,
"We  have 
investments",in  VIEs,,in  which  we  are  not,,the  primary  beneficiary.  These  VIEs,,,,include  private
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve,,,,,,,,,
power generation using renewable sources.,,,,,,,,,
,We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that,,,,,,,,
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and the results,,,,,,,,,
of  operations  and  financial  position  of  these  VIEs  are  not  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  We,,,,,,,,,
account  for  these  investments  primarily  as  non-marketable  equity  securities  or  equity  method  investments  which,,,,,,,,,
are  included  within  non-marketable  securities  on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets.  The  maximum  exposure  of,,,,,,,,,
these  unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future,,,,,,,,,
funding commitments. As of December 31 2023 and September 30 2024 our future funding commitments related,,,,,,,,,
to unconsolidated VIE investments were 1.7 billion and 1.3 billion respectively.,,,,,,,,,

value as of September 30 2024.,,,,,,,,,
