,Achieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path,,
to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results particularly where,,,
they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will,,,
require us to navigate significant uncertainty including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI,,,
which is complex and difficult to predict. In addition solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist,,,
and will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As,,,
our business and industry continue to evolve,,we expect our total GHG emissions to rise,before dropping toward our
absolute emissions reduction target.,,,
