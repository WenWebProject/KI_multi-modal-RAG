Note 10.        Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of 8.8 billion as of
December 31 2024 of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate
"activities  we 
indemnify  certain  parties 
including  advertisers  Google  Network  partners  distribution  partners"
customers of Google Cloud offerings lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed
to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or
out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit
the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition we have entered
"into 
indemnification  agreements  with  our  officers  and  directors  and  our  bylaws  contain  similar 
indemnification"
obligations to our agents.
It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification
"agreements  due 
to 
the  unique 
facts  and  circumstances 
involved 
in  each  particular  agreement.  Additionally 
the"
payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations
cash  flows  or  financial  position.  However  to  the  extent  that  valid  indemnification  claims  arise  in  the  future  future
payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows
in a particular period.
As of December 31 2024 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.
Legal Matters
We  record  a  liability  when  we  believe  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be
reasonably  estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be
estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect
the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been  previously  accrued  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible  losses
disclosed and make adjustments as appropriate.
"Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative  substantial  or 
indeterminate  monetary  amounts  substantial"
changes to our business practices and products or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine
both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters and we may be
unable  to  estimate  the  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  losses.  The  outcomes  of  outstanding  legal  matters  are
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties and could either individually or in aggregate have a
material adverse effect.
