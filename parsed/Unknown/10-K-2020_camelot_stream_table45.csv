in advertising quality or formats and delivery; the evolution of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our,,
investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also,,

,Google Search & other,
,,Google  Search  &  other  revenues  increased  5947  million  from  2019  to  2020.  The  overall  growth  was  primarily
driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and,,
usage  primarily  on  mobile  devices  growth  in  advertiser  spending  primarily  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  and,,
improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. This increase was partially offset by a decline in advertiser,,
spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.,,
,YouTube ads,
,,YouTube  ads  revenues  increased  4623  million  from  2019  to  2020.  Growth  was  primarily  driven  by  our  direct
response advertising products which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser,,
spending.  rand  advertising  products  also  contributed  to  growth  despite  revenues  being  adversely  impacted  by  a,,
decline in advertiser spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.,,

,Use of Monetization Metrics,
,,Paid  clicks  for  our  Google  Search  &  other  properties  represent  engagement  by  users  and  include  clicks  on
advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other owned and operated properties including Gmail,,
Google  Maps  and  Google  Play.  Historically  we  included  certain  viewed  YouTube  engagement  ads  and  the  related,,
revenues in our paid clicks and cost-per-click monetization metrics. Over time advertising on YouTube has expanded,,
to multiple advertising formats and the type of viewed engagement ads historically included in paid clicks and cost-per-,,
click  metrics  have  increasingly  covered  a  smaller  portion  of  YouTube  advertising  revenues.  As  a  result  we  removed,,
these ads and the related revenues from the paid clicks and cost-per-click metrics for the current and historical periods,,
presented. The revised metrics provide a better understanding of monetization trends on the properties included within,,
Google Search & other as they now more closely correlate with the related changes in revenues.,,
,,Impressions  for  our  Google  Network  Members'  properties  include  impressions  displayed  to  users  served  on
Google Network Members' properties participating primarily in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager.,,
,,Cost-per-click  is  defined  as  click-driven  revenues  divided  by  our  total  number  of  paid  clicks  and  represents  the
average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.,,
