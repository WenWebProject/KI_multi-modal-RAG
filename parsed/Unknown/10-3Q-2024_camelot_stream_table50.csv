Costs and Expenses,,,,
,Our  cost  structure  has  two  components:  cost  of  revenues  and  operating  expenses.  Our  operating  expenses,,,
include costs related to R&D sales and marketing and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs,,,,
and expenses including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components,,,,
of  our  operating  expenses  are  generally  less  variable  in  nature  and  may  not  correlate  to  changes  in  revenue.,,,,
Additionally,fluctuations,in  compensation  expenses  may  not  directly  correlate  with  changes,in  headcount,in
particular due to annual SC awards that generally vest over four years.,,,,
