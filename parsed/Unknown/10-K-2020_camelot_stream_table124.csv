CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES"
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our  management  with  the  participation  of  our  chief  executive  officer  and  chief  financial  officer  evaluated  the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end
of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ased on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31
2020 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results.
In 2019 we began a multi-year implementation of a new global ERP system which will replace much of our existing
core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of
"financial 
information 
improve  data  management  and  provide 
timely 
information 
to  our  management 
team.  The"
implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The initial phase which included changes
to  our  general  ledger  and  consolidated  financial  reporting  systems  was  completed  during  the  third  quarter  of  2020.
There  have  been  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  quarter  ended
December 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial  reporting.  However  as  the  phased  implementation  of  the  new  ERP  system  continues  we  will  change  our
processes  and  procedures  which  in  turn  could  result  in  changes  to  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  As
such  changes  occur  we  will  evaluate  quarterly  whether  such  changes  materially  affect  our  internal  control  over
financial reporting.
As a result of COVID-19 our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for
the  quarter  ended  December  31  2020.  While  pre-existing  controls  were  not  specifically  designed  to  operate  in  our
current work from home operating environment we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to
be  effective.  We  have  continued  to  re-evaluate  and  refine  our  financial  reporting  process  to  provide  reasonable
assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework  issued  by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework. ased on this evaluation
management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31  2020.
Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of
our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31  2020  has  been  audited  by  Ernst  &  Young  LLP  an
independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
