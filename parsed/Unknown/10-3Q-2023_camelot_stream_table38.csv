On July 7 2021 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court"
for the Northern District of California alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated
U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  state  antitrust  and  consumer  protection  laws.  In  September  2023  we  reached  a
"settlement 
in  principle  with  50  state  Attorneys  General  and 
three 
territories.  The  U.S.  District  Court"
subsequently vacated the trial date with the states and any final approval of the settlement is expected to
occur in 2024. In May 2022 the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business
practices.  Korean  regulators  are  investigating  Google  Play's  billing  practices  including  a  formal  review  in
May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. On October 6 2023 the Korea
Communications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new
regulations. We intend to respond in November 2023.
