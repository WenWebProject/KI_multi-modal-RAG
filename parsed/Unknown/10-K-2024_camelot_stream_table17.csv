such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns,,
associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power and transmission availability and significant,,
changes  in  the  financial  or  business  condition  of  our  suppliers.  Some  of  the  components  we  use  in  our  technical,,
infrastructure  and  our  devices  are  available  from  only  one  or  limited  sources  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  find,,
replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that,,
affects  us  or  our  vendors  could  delay  critical  data  center  upgrades  or  expansions  and  delay  consumer  product,,
availability.,,
,We  may  enter  into  long-term  contracts  for  materials  and  products  that  commit  us  to  significant  terms  and,
conditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand technological,,
change changed consumer preferences quality product recalls and warranty issues. For instance because certain of,,
our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of sales,,
of our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing,,
costs  or  other  financial  liabilities  that  could  make  our  products  more  costly  per  unit  to  manufacture  and  harm  our,,
financial  condition  and  operating  results.  Furthermore  certain  of  our  competitors  may  negotiate  more  favorable,,
contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and,,
may affect our supply. For example industry supply capacity for AI accelerators including Graphics Processing Units,,
or GPUs as well as our custom-built TPUs is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate,,
favorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first we may face supply constraints.,,
,Our  devices  have  had  and  in  the  future  may  have  quality  issues  resulting  from  design  manufacturing  or,
operations.  Sometimes  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other  manufacturers  or,,
suppliers.  If  the  quality  of  our  products  and  services  does  not  meet  expectations  or  our  products  or  services  are,,
defective or require a recall it could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,
,We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies,
and  practices  such  as  the  Google  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  regarding  workplace  and  employment  practices  data,,

Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key,,
relationships  and  damage  to  our  reputation. Their  failure  to  procure  necessary  license  rights  to  intellectual  property,,
could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.,,

data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are,,
also  subject  to  break-ins  sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism  and  in  some  cases  to  potential  disruptions,,
resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts,,
happening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for,,
all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems,,
affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition our products and services are,,
highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future errors or vulnerabilities,,
which  could  result  in  interruptions  in  or  failure  of  our  services  or  systems.  Any  of  these  incidents  could  impede  or,,
