We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies. The
investments that we are making across Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets reflect our ongoing efforts to
innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content
providers. Our investments in Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets span a wide range of industries beyond
online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return
of  capital  and  in  pursuing  new  strategies  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities.  These  endeavors  may  involve
significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations
and with respect to Other ets the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail
to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones home devices and
wearables which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services rapid adoption
"of 
technological  advancements  by  competitors  short  product 
life  cycles  evolving 
industry  standards  continual"
"improvement 
in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics  and  price  and 
feature  sensitivity  on 
the  part  of"
consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services
including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to
support cloud computing services and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time our
competitors  are  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  cloud-based  services.  Pricing  and  delivery  models  are  competitive
and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.
Within  Other  ets  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health  life  sciences  and  transportation  among
others. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our
offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.
In  addition  new  and  evolving  products  and  services  including  those  that  use  AI  and  machine  learning  raise
ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenges which may negatively affect our brands and demand for
our products and services. ecause all of these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such
strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating
margin in the future.
"Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over 
time  as  a  result  of  a  number  of 
factors 
including 
increasing"
competition. Changes in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy changes product mix and property
mix  and  an  increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also
experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels if there is a decrease in the
rate of adoption of our products services and technologies or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices
used to access our services among other factors.
In  addition  we  may  also  experience  downward  pressure  on  our  operating  margin  resulting  from  a  variety  of
factors  such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields  including  products  and  services  such  as
hardware Google Cloud and subscription products as well as significant investments in Other ets all of which may
have  margins  lower  than  those  we  generate  from  advertising.  We  may  also  experience  downward  pressure  on  our
operating  margins  from  increasing  regulations  increasing  competition  and  increased  costs  for  many  aspects  of  our
business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical
operating  margin  may  not  be  indicative  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information  see  Trends  in  Our
usiness and Financial Effect in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of
our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.
Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for
us.  Various  events  outside  of  our  control  pose  a  threat  to  our  intellectual  property  rights  as  well  as  to  our  products
services and technologies. For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country
in  which  our  products  and  services  are  distributed  or  made  available  through  the  Internet.  Also  the  efforts  we  have
taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for
our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover we may not have
adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the
possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or
unenforceable.
