or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a,,,,,,,,
VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.,,,,,,,,
,,Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination,,,,,,
of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary.,,,,,,,,
Property and Equipment,,,,,,,,
,,Property  and  equipment  includes  the  following  categories:  land  and  buildings  information  technology  assets,,,,,,
construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land offices,,,,,,,,
data  centers  and,,,related  building,improvements.,Information,technology  assets,include  servers  and  network,
equipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet,,,,,,,,
been placed in service.,,,,,,,,
,,Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation  is  recorded  using  the,,,,,,
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated.,,,,,,,,
We  depreciate  buildings  over  periods  of  seven  to  25  years.  We  depreciate  information  technology  assets  generally,,,,,,,,
over a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter,,,,,,,,
of,the  remaining,lease,term  or,the  estimated  useful,lives  of,the  assets.  Depreciation,for  buildings,information
technology  assets  leasehold  improvements  and  furniture  and  fixtures  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our,,,,,,,,
intended use.,,,,,,,,
Goodwill,,,,,,,,
,,We  allocate  goodwill  to  reporting  units  based  on  the  expected  benefit  from  the  business  combination.  We,,,,,,
evaluate  our  reporting  units  periodically  as  well  as  when  changes  in  our  operating  segments  occur.  For  changes  in,,,,,,,,
reporting  units  we  reassign  goodwill  using  a  relative,,,,,,fair  value  allocation  approach.  We,test  our  goodwill,for
impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be,,,,,,,,
impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.,,,,,,,,
Leases,,,,,,,,
,,We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-,,,,,,
lease  components.  Payments  under  our  lease  arrangements  are  primarily  fixed.  Non-lease  components  primarily,,,,,,,,
include  payments  for  maintenance  and  utilities.  We  combine  fixed  payments  for  non-lease  components  with  lease,,,,,,,,
payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets,,,,,,,,
and liabilities.,,,,,,,,
,,Certain  lease  agreements  contain  variable  payments  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  not  included  in  the,,,,,,
lease  assets  and  liabilities.  These  amounts  primarily  include  payments  affected  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  and,,,,,,,,
payments for maintenance and utilities.,,,,,,,,
,,Lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  at  the  lease,,,,,,
commencement  date.  The  interest  rate  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  is  our,,,,,,,,
incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental,,,,,,,,
borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,,,,,,,,
and  in  economic  environments  where  the  leased  asset  is  located.  Our  lease  terms  include  periods  under  options  to,,,,,,,,
extend  or  terminate  the  lease  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option.  We  generally  use  the,,,,,,,,
base  non-cancelable  lease  term  when  determining  the  lease  assets  and  liabilities.  Lease  assets  also  include  any,,,,,,,,
prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.,,,,,,,,
,,Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated alance Sheets. The current portion of our,,,,,,
operating  lease  liabilities  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  and  the  long-term  portion  is,,,,,,,,
included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net. Finance lease,,,,,,,,
liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.,,,,,,,,
,,Operating  lease  expense  excluding  variable  lease  costs  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease,,,,,,
term.,,,,,,,,
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,,,,,,,,
,,We  review  leases  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  excluding  goodwill  for  impairment  when,,,,,,
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed,,,,,,,,
at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by,,,,,,,,
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected,,,,,,,,
