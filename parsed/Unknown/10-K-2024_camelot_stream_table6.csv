PART I
"ITEM 1.
USINESS"
Overview
"As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter ""Google is not a conventional company."
"We do not intend to become one."" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring"
us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and since 2016
an AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments
Google  Services  and  Google  Cloud  and  all  non-Google  businesses  collectively  as  Other  ets.  Supporting  these
businesses  we  have  centralized  certain  AI-related  research  and  development  which  is  reported  in  Alphabet-level
"activities.  Alphabet's  structure 
is  about  helping  each  of  our  businesses  prosper 
through  strong 
leaders  and"
independence.
Access and Technology for Everyone
The Internet is one of the world’s most  powerful equalizers; it propels ideas people and businesses large and
small.  Our  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful  is  as  relevant
today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find
answers to a company that also helps people get things done.
We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools
they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success. Google Search helps people find information
and  make  sense  of  the  world  in  more  natural  and  intuitive  ways  with  trillions  of  searches  on  Google  every  year.
YouTube provides people with entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new and helps support
the  creator  economy  through  the  YouTube  Partner  Program.  Google  Cloud  helps  customers  solve  today’s  business
challenges  improve  productivity  reduce  costs  and  unlock  new  growth  engines.  We  are  continually  innovating  and
building new products and features to help our users partners customers and communities and have invested more
than 150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.
