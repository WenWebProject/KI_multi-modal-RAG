"ITEM 1.
USINESS"
Overview
"As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter ""Google is not a conventional company."
"We do not intend to become one."" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring"
us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence AI. We
continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other ets. Alphabet's
structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.
Access and technology for everyone
The  Internet  is  one  of  the  world’s  most  powerful  equalizers;  it  propels  ideas  people  and  businesses  large  and
small.  Our  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful  is  as  relevant
today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find
answers to a company that also helps people get things done.
We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools
they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success. Google Search helps people find information
and  make  sense  of  the  world  in  more  natural  and  intuitive  ways  with  trillions  of  searches  on  Google  every  year.
YouTube provides people with entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant
offers  the  best  way  to  get  things  done  seamlessly  across  different  devices  providing  intelligent  help  throughout  a
person's  day  no  matter  where  they  are.  Google  Cloud  helps  customers  solve  today’s  business  challenges  improve
productivity reduce costs and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products
and features that will help our users partners customers and communities and have invested more than 100 billion
in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.
