,In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result we
have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in Europe on various tax-,
related assertions such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of,
such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us,
to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and,
regulatory inquiries resulting in the diversion of managementâ€™s time and attention. In addition the determination of our,
worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many,
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates,
are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may,
affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.,
