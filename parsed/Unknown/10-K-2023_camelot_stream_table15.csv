that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products
and services and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal
or  better  products  and  services.  Competitorsâ€™  success  in  providing  compelling  products  and  services  or  in  attracting
and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers could harm our financial condition and
operating results.
Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and
could divert management attention and harm our business financial condition and operating results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies in a
wide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses such
as  building  AI  capabilities  into  new  and  existing  products  and  services  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to  innovate  and
provide products and services that are helpful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers. Our
investments  ultimately  may  not  be  commercially  viable  or  may  not  result  in  an  adequate  return  of  capital  and  in
pursuing  new  strategies  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities.  Innovations  in  our  products  and  services  could  also
result  in  changes  to  user  behavior  and  affect  our  revenue  trends.  These  endeavors  involve  significant  risks  and
"uncertainties 
including  diversion  of 
resources  and  management  attention 
from  current  operations  different"
monetization models and the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail to
adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in devices including our smartphones home devices and
wearables  which  is  a  highly  competitive  market  with  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services  rapid
adoption  of  technological  advancements  by  competitors  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries  short
product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in performance characteristics and price and
feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and  businesses. There  can  be  no  assurance  we  will  be  able  to  provide
devices that compete effectively.
Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services
including  Google  Cloud  Platform  and  Google  Workspace  and  we  are  advancing  our  AI  platforms  and  models  to
support  these  tools  and  technologies.  We  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud
computing  services  invest  in  cybersecurity  and  hire  talent  particularly  to  support  and  scale  our  sales  force. At  the
same  time  our  competitors  are  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  cloud-based  services.  Pricing  and  delivery  models
are competitive and constantly evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business
objectives.  Further  our  business  with  public  sector  customers  may  present  additional  risks  including  regulatory
compliance risks. For instance we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews and any failure to comply or
any deficiencies found may expose us to legal financial and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may
require  us  to  make  new  capital  investments  build  new  products  and  seek  partners  to  deliver  localized  services  in
other countries and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.
Within Other ets we are investing significantly in the areas of health life sciences and transportation among
others. These  investment  areas  face  intense  competition  from  large  experienced  and  well-funded  competitors  and
our offerings many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies may not be successful or be
able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.
In  addition  new  and  evolving  products  and  services  including  those  that  use  AI  raise  ethical  technological
legal  regulatory  and  other  challenges  which  may  negatively  affect  our  brands  and  demand  for  our  products  and
services. ecause all of these investment areas are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies
and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results.
Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over  time  and  we  may  experience  downward  pressure  on  our
operating margin in the future.
Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over  time  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  factors  including  changes  in  the
devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines
in  advertiser  spending;  competition;  customer  usage  and  demand  for  our  products;  decreases  in  our  pricing  of  our
products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.
In addition we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors
such as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services in particular from the continued expansion of our
"business 
into  new 
fields 
including  products  and  services  such  as  our  devices  Google  Cloud  and  consumer"
subscription products as well as significant investments in Other ets all of which may have margins lower than those
we generate from advertising. In particular margins on our devices have had and may continue to have an adverse
effect  on  our  consolidated  margins  due  to  pressures  on  pricing  and  higher  cost  of  sales.  We  may  also  experience
