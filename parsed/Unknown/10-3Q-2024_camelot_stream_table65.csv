,The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended September 30 2023 to the three months ended,,,
September  30  2024.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  a  cumulative  one-time  adjustment  recorded  for  tax  rule,,,,
changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service IRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally a decrease in the,,,,
U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.,,,,
,The effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30 2023 to the nine months ended,,,
September 30 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the,,,,
IRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income,,,,
tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase,,,,
in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.,,,,
,The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus,,,
around substantial changes to international tax policies including the implementation of a minimum global effective,,,,
tax rate of 15. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1 2024 and we expect,,,,
others to follow however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As,,,,
additional  jurisdictions  enact  such  legislation  transitional  rules  lapse  and  other  provisions  of  the  minimum  tax,,,,
legislation become effective we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.,,,,
