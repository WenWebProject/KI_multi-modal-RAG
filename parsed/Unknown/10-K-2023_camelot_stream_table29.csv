"•
Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the oard of Directors or to"
propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter
a  potential  acquirer  from  conducting  a  solicitation  of  proxies  to  elect  the  acquirer's  own  slate  of  directors  or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
"•
Our  oard  of  Directors  may  issue  without  stockholder  approval  shares  of  undesignated  preferred  stock"
which  makes  it  possible  for  our  oard  of  Directors  to  issue  preferred  stock  with  voting  or  other  rights  or
preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
As  a  Delaware  corporation  we  are  also  subject  to  certain  Delaware  anti-takeover  provisions.  Under  Delaware
law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting
stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the oard of Directors has approved
the transaction. Our oard of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
The trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.
The  trading  price  of  our  stock  has  at  times  experienced  significant  volatility  and  may  continue  to  be  volatile.  In
addition  to  the  factors  discussed  in  this  report  the  trading  prices  of  our  Class  A  stock  and  Class  C  stock  have
fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control
including among others the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around
the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C
stock regardless of our actual operating performance.
General Risks
Our  operating  results  may  fluctuate  which  makes  our  results  difficult  to  predict  and  could  cause  our
results to fall short of expectations.
Our operating results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many
outside of our control including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result
comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a period-to-period basis
may  not  be  meaningful  and  our  past  results  should  not  be  relied  on  as  an  indication  of  our  future  performance.
Consequently our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.
Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution
and other consequences that could harm our business financial condition and operating results.
Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy
and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect
to  continue  to  evaluate  and  enter  into  discussions  regarding  a  wide  array  of  such  potential  strategic  arrangements
which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:
"•
diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and"
other strategic arrangements;
"•
failure  to  obtain  required  approvals  on  a  timely  basis  if  at  all  from  governmental  authorities  or  conditions"
placed  upon  approval  that  could  among  other  things  delay  or  prevent  us  from  completing  a  transaction  or
otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;
"•
failure  to  successfully  integrate  the  acquired  operations  technologies  services  and  personnel  including"
cultural integration and retention of employees and further develop the acquired business or technology;
"•
implementation  of  controls  or  remediation  of  control  deficiencies  procedures  and  policies  at  the  acquired"
company;
"•
integration  of  the  acquired  company’s  accounting  and  other  administrative  systems  and  the  coordination  of"
product engineering and sales and marketing functions;
"•
transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms;"
"•
in  the  case  of  foreign  acquisitions  the  need  to  integrate  operations  across  different  cultures  and  languages"
and  to  address  the  particular  economic  currency  political  and  regulatory  risks  associated  with  specific
countries;
"•
failure to accomplish commercial strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments joint ventures"
and other strategic arrangements;
