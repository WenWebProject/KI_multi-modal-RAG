Capital Expenditures and Leases
We  make  investments  in  land  and  buildings  for  data  centers  and  offices  and  information  technology  assets
through  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and  lease  arrangements  to  provide  capacity  for  the  growth  of  our
services and products.
Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
"•
Technical  infrastructure  which  consists  of  our  investments  in  servers  and  network  equipment  for  compute"
storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities including machine learning collectively
referred to as our information technology assets and data center land and building construction; and
"•
Office facilities ground up development projects and related building improvements."
Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet our technical infrastructure and office facilities are managed centrally at
a consolidated level. The associated costs including depreciation and impairment are allocated to operating segments
as  a  service  cost  generally  based  on  usage  or  headcount.  Our  technical  infrastructure  investments  are  designed  to
support all of Alphabet including primarily ads Google Cloud Search and YouTube.
Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been
placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets
may  extend  to  multiple  periods.  For  example  our  data  center  construction  projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects
with  multiple  phases  where  we  acquire  qualified  land  and  buildings  construct  buildings  and  secure  and  install
information technology assets.
During  the  years  ended  December  31  2019  and  2020  we  spent  23.5  billion  and  22.3  billion  on  capital
expenditures and recognized total operating lease assets of 4.4 billion and 2.8 billion respectively. As of December
31 2020 the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases which had a weighted average remaining
lease  term  of  9  years  was  15.1  billion.  As  of  December  31  2020  we  have  entered  into  leases  that  have  not  yet
commenced  with  future  lease  payments  of  8.0  billion  excluding  purchase  options  that  are  not  yet  recorded  on  our
Consolidated alance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms
of 1 to 25 years.
Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and
are  ready  for  our  intended  use.  Land  is  not  depreciated.  For  the  years  ended  December  31  2019  and  2020  our
depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were 10.9 billion and 12.9 billion respectively.
For the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 our operating lease expenses including variable lease costs
were  2.4  billion  and  2.9  billion  respectively.  Finance  leases  were  not  material  for  the  years  ended  December  31
2019 and 2020. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of
