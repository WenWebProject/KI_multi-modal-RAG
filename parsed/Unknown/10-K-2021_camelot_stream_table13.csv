RISK FACTORS",,,,
,Our  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties  including  but  not  limited  to,,,
those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results and affect,,,,
the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.,,,,
,Risks Specific to our Company,,,
,We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers,,,
a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize,,,,
ads could harm our business.,,,,
,We generated more than 80 of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2021. Many of our advertisers,,,
companies  that  distribute  our  products  and  services  digital  publishers  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their,,,,
contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value,,,,
such  as  increased  numbers  of  users  or  customers  new  sales  leads  increased  brand  awareness  or  more  effective,,,,
monetization than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well,,,,
as changes to other companiesâ€™ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past and may in the future affect,,,,
the  advertising  that  we  are  able  to  provide  which  could  harm  our  business.  In  addition  technologies  have  been,,,,
developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of,,,,
online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party,,,,
digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm,,,,
our reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,In addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting,,,
and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect the demand for,,,,
advertising resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising which could harm our financial,,,,
condition and operating results.,,,,
,We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are,,,
useful  to  users  customers  and  other  partners  we  may  not  remain  competitive  which  could  harm  our,,,,
business and operating results.,,,,
Our  business  environment,is,rapidly  evolving  and,intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses,face  changing
technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,,,,
we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services,,,,
and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a,,,,
wider  range  of  products  and  services.  We  must  continue  to  invest  significant  resources  in  R&D  including  through,,,,
acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.,,,,
We  have  many  competitors,,in  different,industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and,international
"competitors  range 
from",large  and  established  companies,,to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have,longer
operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources,,,,
in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in R&D,,,,
and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete,,,,
aggressively for users advertisers customers and content providers. Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing,,,,
laws  may  enable  our  lesser  known  competitors  to  aggressively  interpret  those  laws  without  commensurate  scrutiny,,,,
thereby  affording  them  competitive  advantages.  Our  competitors  may  also  be  able  to  innovate  and  provide  products,,,,
and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.,,,,
,Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users,,,
advertisers publishers customers and content providers. As technologies continue to develop our competitors may,,,,
be able to offer experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force,,,,
us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are,,,,
more  successful  than  we  are  in  providing  compelling  products  and  services  or  in  attracting  and  retaining  users,,,,
advertisers publishers customers and content providers our operating results could be harmed.,,,,
,Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and,,,
could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results.,,,,
