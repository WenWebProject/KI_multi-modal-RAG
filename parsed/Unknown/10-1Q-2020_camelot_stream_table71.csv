erode confidence in our brand. In addition the events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government
inquiries.  Any  such  inquiries  could  subject  us  to  substantial  fines  and  costs  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  divert  resources  and  the  attention  of
management from our business or adversely affect our business.
In addition the changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the security of our systems as well as our ability to
protect  against  attacks  and  detect  and  respond  to  them  quickly.  The  rapid  adoption  of  some  third-party  services  designed  to  enable  the  transition  to  a  remote
workforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased cyber-attacks such as
phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel.
We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other
undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.
In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in privacy safety security and content review efforts to
combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications that previously accessed information of a
large  number  of  users  of  our  services.  As  a  result  of  these  efforts  we  have  discovered  and  announced  and  anticipate  that  we  will  continue  to  discover  and
announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a
result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform challenges related to our personnel
working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic the re-allocation of resources to other projects or other factors and we may be notified of such incidents or
activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC the media or other third parties. Such incidents and activities
have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of
false  or  undesirable  user  accounts  election  interference  improper  advertising  practices  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  on-  or  offline  or  instances  of
spamming scraping or spreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents.
Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in
a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and
regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert management's time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.
Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business.
We  receive  a  high  degree  of  media  coverage  around  the  world.  Unfavorable  publicity  regarding  for  example  our  privacy  practices  terms  of  service
advertising policies product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our
developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends the substance or enforcement of our
community standards the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar
services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation. For example beginning in March 2018 we were the subject of intense
media coverage involving the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies and we have
continued to receive negative publicity. In addition we may be subject to negative publicity if we are not successful in our efforts to prevent misinformation or
other  illicit  or  objectionable  use  of our  products  or  services  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19 pandemic  the  2020 U.S. presidential  election  or other  elections
around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue
which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.
Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally we have a limited operating history with the current
scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of
future  performance.  You  should  take  into  account  the  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  encountered  by  companies  in  rapidly  evolving  markets.  Our  financial
results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including:
