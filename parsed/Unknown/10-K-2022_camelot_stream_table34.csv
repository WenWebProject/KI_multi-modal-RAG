Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other ets. For further
details on our segments see Part I Item 1 “usiness” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trends in Our usiness and Financial Effect
The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate
that they will continue to affect our future results:
"•
Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves."
The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues
since  inception.  We  expect  that  this  shift  to  an  online  world  will  continue  to  benefit  our  business  and  our  revenues
although  at  a  slower  pace  than  we  have  experienced  historically  in  particular  after  the  outsized  growth  in  our
advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition we face increasing competition for user engagement
and advertisers which may affect our revenues.
"•
Users  continue  to  access  our  products  and  services  using  diverse  devices  and  modalities  which"
allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.
Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones wearables and
smart home devices and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are
focused  on  expanding  our  products  and  services  to  stay  in  front  of  these  trends  in  order  to  maintain  and  grow  our
business.
We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels including mobile and newer advertising
formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional
desktop search. Additionally as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our advertising revenues
may be affected. For example growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors including
increased market saturation in developed countries which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.
We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow
"and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues ""TAC rate"" to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic"
mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product
mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.
We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.
"•
As  online  advertising  evolves  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings  which  may  affect  our"
monetization.
As  interactions  between  users  and  advertisers  change  and  as  online  user  behavior  evolves  we  continue  to
expand  our  product  offerings  to  serve  these  changing  needs  which  may  affect  our  monetization.  For  example
revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may
"develop  new  products 
incorporating  AI 
innovations 
that  could  affect  our  monetization 
trends.  Additionally  when"
developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.
"•
As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets"
continue  to  increase  and  may  require  continued  investments.  In  addition  movements  in  foreign  exchange
rates affect such revenues.
The shift to online as well as the advent of the multi-device world has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.
including  in  emerging  markets  such  as  India.  We  continue  to  invest  heavily  and  develop  localized  versions  of  our
products  and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased
