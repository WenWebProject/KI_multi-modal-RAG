RISK FACTORS",,,,
,Our  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties  including  but  not  limited  to,,,
those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,Risks Specific to our Company,,,
,We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers,,,
a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize,,,,
ads could harm our business.,,,,
,We  generated  over  80  of  total  revenues  from  the  display  of  ads  online  in  2020.  Many  of  our  advertisers,,,
companies  that  distribute  our  products  and  services  digital  publishers  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their,,,,
contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value,,,,
such  as  increased  numbers  of  users  or  customers  new  sales  leads  increased  brand  awareness  or  more  effective,,,,
monetization than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well,,,,
as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices may affect the advertising that we are able to,,,,
provide  which  could  harm  our  business.  In  addition  technologies  have  been  developed  that  make  customized  ads,,,,
more  difficult  or  that  block  the  display  of  ads  altogether  and  some  providers  of  online  services  have  integrated,,,,
technologies  that  could  potentially  impair  the  availability  and  functionality  of  third-party  digital  advertising.  Failing  to,,,,
provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  reputation  financial,,,,
condition and operating results.,,,,
,In addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting,,,
and  buying  patterns.  Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions  including  COVID-19  and  its  effects  on  the  global  economy,,,,
as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below have impacted the demand for,,,,
advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising and could have an adverse,,,,
impact on such demand and spend which could harm our financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are,,,
useful to users we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating results.,,,,
Our  business  environment,is,rapidly  evolving  and,intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses,face  changing
technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,,,,
we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services,,,,
and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a,,,,
wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development,,,,
including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.,,,,
We  have  many  competitors,,in  different,industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and,international
"competitors  range 
from",large  and  established  companies,,to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have,longer
operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources,,,,
in  ways  that  could  affect  our  competitive  position  including  by  making  acquisitions  continuing  to  invest  heavily  in,,,,
research and development and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious,,,,
"and 
continuing 
to",compete  aggressively,for  users  advertisers,customers  and,content  providers.  Further
discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those,,,,
laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able,,,,
to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services,,,,
before us.,,,,
,Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users,,,
advertisers publishers customers and content providers. As technologies continue to develop our competitors may,,,,
be able to offer experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours. This,,,,
