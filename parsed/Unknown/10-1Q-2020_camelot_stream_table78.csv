We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related
to our products and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices.
We  have  faced  currently  face  and  will  continue  to  face  claims  relating  to  information  or  content  that  is  published  or  made  available  on  our  products
including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to
defamation  dissemination  of  misinformation  or  news  hoaxes  discrimination  harassment  intellectual  property  rights  rights  of  publicity  and  privacy  personal
injury torts laws regulating hate speech or other types of content and breach of contract among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the
United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the
United States. For example in April 2019 the European Union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating
certain uses of news content online which member states must implement by June 2021. In addition the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media
Service Directive which must be implemented by member states by September 2020 to apply to online video-sharing platforms. In the United States there have
been various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as
well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to counterfeit goods and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the
United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages.
We  could  also  face  fines  or  orders  restricting  or  blocking  our  services  in  particular  geographies  as  a  result  of  content  hosted  on  our  services.  For  example
legislation in Germany has in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement
cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations.  Other  countries  including  Australia  France  Ireland  Singapore  and  the  United  Kingdom  are  considering  or  have
implemented similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. Such legislation also has in the past
and may in the future require us to change our products or business practices increase our compliance costs or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to
provide services in certain geographies. For example the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted
content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. If any
of the foregoing events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
Mark  Zuckerberg  our  founder  Chairman  and  CEO  is  able  to  exercise  voting  rights  with  respect  to  a  majority  of  the  voting  power  of  our  outstanding
capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any
merger  consolidation  or  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets.  This  concentrated  control  could  delay  defer  or  prevent  a  change  of  control  merger
consolidation  or  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets  that  our  other  stockholders  support  or  conversely  this  concentrated  control  could  result  in  the
consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring
our Class A common stock which has limited voting power relative to the Class  common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.
In addition Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and
his  ability  to  control  the  election  or  replacement  of  our  directors.  In  the  event  of  his  death  the  shares  of  our  capital  stock  that  Mr.  Zuckerberg  owns  will  be
transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act
in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder even a controlling stockholder Mr. Zuckerberg is
entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the
interests of our stockholders generally.
We plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common
stock.
As part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies
products or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all.
In some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions.
