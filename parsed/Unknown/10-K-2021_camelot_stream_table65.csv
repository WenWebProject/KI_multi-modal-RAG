Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties including the effects of COVID-19. On,,,,,
an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of,,,,,
financial  instruments  intangible  assets  and  goodwill;  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  and  property  and  equipment;,,,,,
income  taxes;  and  contingent  liabilities  among  others.  We  base  our  estimates  on  assumptions  both  historical  and,,,,,
forward looking that are believed to be reasonable and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about,,,,,
the carrying values of assets and liabilities.,,,,,
,In  January  2021  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and,,,,
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain,,,,,
network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal,,,,,
