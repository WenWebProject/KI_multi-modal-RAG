Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,,
Nature of Operations,,

"2003. In 2015 we implemented a holding company reorganization and as a result Alphabet Inc. ""Alphabet"" became",,

,We generate revenues by delivering relevant cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide,
enterprise  customers  of  all  sizes  with  infrastructure  platform  services  and  applications;  sales  of  other  products  and,,
services such as fees received for subscription-based products apps and in-app purchases and devices.,,
asis of Consolidation,,
,The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Alphabet  include  the  accounts  of  Alphabet  and  entities  consolidated,
under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.,,
Use of Estimates,,
,Preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and,
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.,,
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our,,
estimates  including  those  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses;  contingent  liabilities;  fair  values  of  financial,,
instruments  and  goodwill;  income  taxes;  inventory;  and  useful  lives  of  property  and  equipment  among  others.  We,,
base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable and the,,
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.,,
Revenue Recognition,,
,Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and,
the  collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other,,
similar taxes are excluded from revenues.,,
