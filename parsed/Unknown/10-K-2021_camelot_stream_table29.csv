In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork. As our organization
grows  and  evolves  we  may  need  to  implement  more  complex  organizational  management  structures  or  adapt  our
corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or
pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate
culture.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and in some instances our financial
statements  incorporate  valuation  methodologies  that  are  subjective  in  nature  resulting  in  fluctuations  over
time.
The fair value of our investments may in the future be and certain investments have been in the past negatively
affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying entities foreign

We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities certain other instruments including stock-
based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other ets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate
valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs requires management judgment and estimation and may change
over time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions
of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity
securities are recognized in other income expense which increases the volatility of our other income expense. The
unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any
particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments.
As  a  result  of  these  factors  the  value  or  liquidity  of  our  cash  equivalents  as  well  as  our  marketable  and  non-
marketable  securities  could  decline  and  result  in  a  material  impairment  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial
condition and operating results.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or
exposure to additional tax liabilities.
Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that
have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net

In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result we
have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in Europe on various tax-
related assertions such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of
such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us
to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and
regulatory inquiries resulting in the diversion of managementâ€™s time and attention. In addition the determination of our
worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  significant  judgment  and  there  are  many
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates
are  reasonable  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  may  differ  from  the  amounts  recorded  in  our  financial  statements  and  may
affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions
may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. Various jurisdictions around the world
have  enacted  or  are  considering  digital  services  taxes  which  could  lead  to  inconsistent  and  potentially  overlapping
international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD continues to advance
proposals  relating  to  its  initiative  for  modernizing  international  tax  rules  with  the  goal  of  having  different  countries
implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework but there can be no guarantee that this will occur.
In  addition  in  response  to  significant  market  volatility  and  disruptions  to  business  operations  resulting  from  the
global spread of COVID-19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose
changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent
