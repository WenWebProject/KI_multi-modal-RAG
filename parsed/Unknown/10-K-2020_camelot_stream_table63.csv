In  determining  the  fair  values  of  our  non-marketable  equity  and  debt  investments  as  well  as  assets  acquired
especially  with  respect  to  intangible  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  in  business  combinations  we  make  significant
estimates and assumptions some of which include the use of unobservable inputs.
Certain  stock-based  compensation  awards  may  be  settled  in  the  stock  of  certain  of  our  Other  ets  or  in  cash.
These awards are based on the equity values of the respective Other et which requires use of unobservable inputs.
We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns i.e. performance
fees. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized
before investment returns are realized and may require the use of unobservable inputs.
Non-marketable Equity Securities
Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or
under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative the carrying value is measured at cost less
any impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical
or a similar investment of the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within
our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and obligations of the securities. Recording upward and downward
adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative
"assessments  of 
the 
fair  value  of  our  securities  using  various  valuation  methodologies  and 
involves 
the  use  of"
estimates.
Non-marketable  equity  securities  are  also  subject  to  periodic  impairment  reviews.  Our  quarterly  impairment
analysis  considers  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  that  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  investment's  fair
value. Qualitative factors considered include the companies' financial and liquidity position access to capital resources
and  the  time  since  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value  among  others.  When  indicators  of  impairment  exist  we  prepare
quantitative  assessments  of  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  investments  using  both  the  market  and  income  approaches
"which  require 
judgment  and 
the  use  of  estimates 
including  discount  rates 
investee  revenues  and  costs  and"
comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies  among  others.  When  our  assessment  indicates  that  an
impairment exists we write down the investment to its fair value.
Change in Accounting Estimate
In  January  2021  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and
determined we should adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated
useful  life  of  certain  network  equipment  from  three  years  to  five  years.  This  change  in  accounting  estimate  will  be
effective  beginning  fiscal  year  2021.  For  assets  that  are  in-service  as  of  December  31  2020  we  expect  operating
results to be favorably impacted by approximately 2.1 billion for the full fiscal year 2021. The effect of the change may
be different due to our capital investments during the fiscal year 2021.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES AOUT MARKET RISK"
We  are  exposed  to  financial  market  risks  including  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  interest  rates
and equity investment risks.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues as well as costs and expenses
denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the
U.S.  dollar.  Principal  currencies  hedged  included  the  Australian  dollar  ritish  pound  Canadian  dollar  Euro  and
Japanese  yen.  For  the  purpose  of  analyzing  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  we  considered  the  historical  trends  in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in  exchange
rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term.
We  use  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  to  offset  the  foreign  exchange  risk  on  our  assets  and  liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce but do
not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign
currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by
the gains and losses on the forward contracts.
If  an  adverse  10  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  total  monetary  assets  liabilities  and
commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have
resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately 8 million and 497 million as of
