The Effect of COVID-19 on our Financial Results,
,We began to observe the effect of COVID-19 on our financial results in March 2020 when despite an increase in
users'  search  activity  our  advertising  revenues  declined  compared  to  the  prior  year.  This  was  due  to  a  shift  of  user,
search  activity  to  less  commercial  topics  and  reduced  spending  by  our  advertisers.  For  the  quarter  ended  June  30,
2020 our advertising revenues declined due to the continued effects of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global,
economic  activity  but  we  observed  a  gradual  return  in  user  search  activity  to  more  commercial  topics.  This  was,
followed by increased spending by our advertisers which continued throughout the second half of 2020. Additionally,
over the course of 2020 we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature,
and/or  may  not  correlate  to  changes  in  revenues.  Market  volatility  contributed  to  fluctuations  in  the  valuation  of  our,
equity  investments.  Further  our  assessment  of  the  credit  deterioration  of  our  customers  due  to  changes  in  the,
macroeconomic environment during the period was reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable.,
,Throughout  2021  we  remained  focused  on  innovating  and  investing  in  the  services  we  offer  to  consumers  and
businesses to support our long-term growth. The impact of COVID-19 on 2020 financial results affected year-over-year,
growth  trends.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  evolve  be  unpredictable  and  affect  our  business  and  financial,
results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in our financial results,
may differ materially.,
