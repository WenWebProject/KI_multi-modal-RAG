,these events.
,In addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity
securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating,
performance of those companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain,
data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second,
quarter of 2018. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert,
resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.,
We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.,
,We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion
of our business and fund our share repurchase program and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result you may,
only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.,
The dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our,
CEO and certain other holders of our Class  common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.,
,Our  Class    common  stock  has  ten  votes  per  share  and  our  Class  A  common  stock  has  one  vote  per  share.  Stockholders  who  hold  shares  of  Class  
common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of,
our outstanding capital stock. ecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class  and Class A common stock the holders of our Class  common stock,
collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for,
approval  so  long  as  the  shares  of  Class    common  stock  represent  at  least  9.1  of  all  outstanding  shares  of  our  Class  A  and  Class    common  stock.  This,
concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.,
,Transfers by holders of Class  common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock subject to limited exceptions such
as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class  common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect,
over  time  of  increasing  the  relative  voting  power  of  those  holders  of  Class    common  stock  who  retain  their  shares  in  the  long  term.  If  for  example,
Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class  common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a,
majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.,
"Our status as a ""controlled company"" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.",
,"ecause we qualify as a ""controlled company"" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies we are not required to have a majority of"
our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect,
not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly,
should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to,
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make,
our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.,
Delaware  law  and  provisions  in  our  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  could  make  a  merger  tender  offer  or  proxy  contest  difficult  thereby,
depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.,
,Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change
in  control  by  prohibiting  us  from  engaging  in  a  business  combination  with  an  interested  stockholder  for  a  period  of  three  years  after  the  person  becomes  an,
interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and,
bylaws contain provisions,
