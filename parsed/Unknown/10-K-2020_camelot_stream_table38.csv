MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF"
OPERATIONS
Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with
our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
We have omitted discussion of 2018 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in
Part II Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trends in Our usiness
The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate
that they will continue to affect our future results:
"•
Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves."
The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception
contributing to revenue growth and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.
"•
Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services and"
our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.
Our  users  are  accessing  the  Internet  via  diverse  devices  and  modalities  such  as  smartphones  wearables  and
smart home devices and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand
our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.
"We  generate  our  advertising 
revenues 
increasingly 
from  different  channels 
including  mobile  and  newer"
advertising  formats  and  the  margins  from  the  advertising  revenues  from  these  channels  and  newer  products  have
generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally as the market for a particular device type
or modality matures our revenues may be affected. For example growth in the global smartphone market has slowed
due  to  various  factors  including  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries  which  can  affect  our  mobile
advertising revenue growth rates.
We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network Members to increase as our revenues grow
and to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of
queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues
from different channels; and revenue share terms.
We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our overall margins.
"•
As  online  advertising  evolves  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings  which  may  affect  our"
monetization.
As  interactions  between  users  and  advertisers  change  and  as  online  user  behavior  evolves  we  continue  to
expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time we expect our monetization trends
to fluctuate. For example we have seen an increase in YouTube ads and Google Play ads which monetize at a lower
rate than our traditional search ads.
"•
As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets"
continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.
The shift to online as well as the advent of the multi-device world has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.
including in emerging markets such as India where we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our
products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased
revenues from international markets over time as regions with emerging markets such as APAC have demonstrated
higher  revenue  growth  rates.  We  expect  that  our  results  will  continue  to  be  affected  by  our  performance  in  these
markets  particularly  as  low-cost  mobile  devices  become  more  available.  This  trend  could  impact  our  margins  as
developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign
currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  While  we  have  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program
designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues
and earnings.
