User Geography
Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location.
These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy
server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other
technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.
