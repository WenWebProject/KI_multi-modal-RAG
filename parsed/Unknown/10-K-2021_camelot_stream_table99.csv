,Certain  of  these  outstanding  matters  include  speculative  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts.  We
record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably,
estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated  we,
disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of,
liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make,
adjustments  as  appropriate.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  the  likelihood  of  there  being  and  the,
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.,
,With respect to our outstanding matters based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of
reasonably  possible  loss  will  not  either  individually  or  in  aggregate  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows. However the outcome of such matters is inherently,
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.,
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.,
Non-Income Taxes,
,We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The
subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the,
sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue,
non-income taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when,
a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of,
loss  can  be  estimated  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and  uncertainty  of,
these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially  different  from  our,
expectations.,
