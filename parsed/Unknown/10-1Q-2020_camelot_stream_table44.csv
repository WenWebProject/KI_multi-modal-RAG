Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook
Instagram Messenger and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with
advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users.
We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered
delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer
contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products.
We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless
of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis.
Other revenue. Other  revenue  consists  of  revenue  from  the  delivery  of  consumer  hardware  devices  and  net  fees  we  receive  from  developers  using  our
Payments infrastructure as well as revenue from various other sources.
