,In addition we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with
laws and regulations including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulations established by the,
U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.K. ribery Act 2010. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they,
may  seek  to  impose  against  companies  for  violations  of  export  controls  anti-corruption  laws  or  regulations  and  other  laws  rules  sanctions  embargoes  and,
regulations.,
,If  we  are  unable  to  expand  internationally  and  manage  the  complexity  of  our  global  operations  successfully  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely
affected.,
We face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results.,
,We face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example
the  consumer  hardware  products  we  sell  may  have  quality  issues  resulting  from  the  design  or  manufacture  of  the  products  or  from  the  software  used  in  the,
products.  Sometimes  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other  manufacturers  or  suppliers.  If  the  quality  of  our  consumer  hardware,
products does not meet our customers' expectations or such products are found to be defective then our brand and financial results could be adversely affected.,
,We rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products which subjects us to a
number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may experience supply shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the,
supply chain that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations product development and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are,
not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether,
due to financial difficulties manufacturing constraints or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with,
them. The manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions geopolitical,
challenges trade disputes or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages increased costs or supply chain disruptions.,
,We  also  require  the  suppliers  and  business  partners  of  our  consumer  hardware  products  to  comply  with  laws  and  certain  company  policies  regarding
sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If,
any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt,
or non-compliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation.,
We face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.,
,We are  exposed to inventory  risks with respect  to our consumer  hardware  products as a result  of rapid  changes  in product  cycles  and pricing  unsafe  or
defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products,
and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we,
endeavor  to  accurately  predict  these  trends  and  avoid  overstocking  or  understocking  consumer  hardware  products  we  may  sell  from  time  to  time  we  have,
experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new,
consumer hardware product or enter new international markets it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component,
selection and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they,
may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.,
