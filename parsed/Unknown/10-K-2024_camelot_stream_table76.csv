the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most
significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses
or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a
VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.
Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination
of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary.
Property and Equipment
"Property  and  equipment 
is  comprised  of 
technical 
infrastructure  office  space  corporate  and  other  assets"
currently  in  service  and  assets  not  yet  in  service.  Technical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land  buildings  and
"leasehold 
improvements  and  servers  and  network  equipment.  Office  space 
includes  office 
land  buildings  and"
leasehold  improvements. Assets  not  yet  in  service  are  those  that  are  not  ready  for  our  intended  use  including  data
center buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly.
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets
are  ready  for  our  intended  use  and  is  recorded  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the
"assets  which  we  regularly  evaluate 
for 
factors  such  as 
technological  obsolescence  and  our  planned  use  and"
utilization. We depreciate  data  center and office buildings over periods  of  seven to 40 years.  We depreciate servers
and network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of
two to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
We  allocate  goodwill  to  reporting  units  based  on  the  expected  benefit  from  the  business  combination.  We
evaluate  our  reporting  units  periodically  as  well  as  when  changes  in  our  operating  segments  occur.  For  changes  in
"reporting  units  we  reassign  goodwill  using  a  relative 
fair  value  allocation  approach.  We 
test  our  goodwill 
for"
impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be
impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-
lease  components.  Payments  under  our  lease  arrangements  are  primarily  fixed.  Non-lease  components  primarily
include  payments  for  maintenance  and  utilities.  We  combine  fixed  payments  for  non-lease  components  with  lease
payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets
and liabilities.
Certain  lease  agreements  contain  variable  payments  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  not  included  in  the
lease  assets  and  liabilities.  These  amounts  primarily  include  payments  affected  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  and
payments for maintenance and utilities.
Lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  at  the  lease
commencement  date.  The  interest  rate  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  is  our
incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental
borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments
and  in  economic  environments  where  the  leased  asset  is  located.  Our  lease  terms  include  periods  under  options  to
extend  or  terminate  the  lease  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option.  We  generally  use  the
base  non-cancelable  lease  term  when  determining  the  lease  assets  and  liabilities.  Lease  assets  also  include  any
prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.
"Lease  assets  and 
liabilities  are 
included  on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets.  The  current  portion  of  our"
operating  lease  liabilities  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  and  the  long-term  portion  is
included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net. Finance lease
liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.
Operating  lease  expense  excluding  variable  lease  costs  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease
term. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life
of the asset and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We  review  leases  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  excluding  goodwill  for  impairment  when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed
