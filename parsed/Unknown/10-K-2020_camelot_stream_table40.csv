"While  we  continued 
to  make 
investments 
in 
land  and  buildings","for  data  centers  offices  and 
information"
technology  in  2020  we  slowed  the  pace  of  our  investments  primarily  as  it  relates  to  office  facilities  as  a  result  of,
COVID-19.,
,The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business continues to evolve and be unpredictable. For example to the
extent  the  pandemic  disrupts  economic  activity  globally  we  like  other  businesses  are  not  immune  to  continued,
adverse  impacts  to  our  business  operations  and  financial  results  from  volatility  in  advertising  spending  changes  in,
user  behavior  and  preferences  credit  deterioration  and  liquidity  of  our  customers  depressed  economic  activity  or,
volatility in capital markets. The ongoing impact will depend on a number of factors including the duration and severity,
of  the  pandemic;  the  uneven  impact  to  certain  industries;  advances  in  testing  treatment  and  prevention  including,
vaccines;  and  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  government  measures  to  contain  the  spread  of  the  virus  and  related,
government stimulus measures.,
,To  address  the  potential  impact  to  our  business  over  the  near-term  we  continue  to  evaluate  the  pace  of  our
investment plans including but not limited to our hiring investments in data centers servers network equipment real,
estate and facilities marketing and travel spending as well as taking certain measures to support our customers our,
overall  workforce  and  communities  we  operate  in.  As  we  look  to  return  our  workforce  in  more  locations  back  to  the,
office in 2021 we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment,
and experiment with hybrid work models. At the same time we believe the current environment is accelerating digital,
"transformation  and  we  remain 
focused  on 
innovating  and 
investing 
in","the  services  we  offer 
to  consumers  and"
businesses. For example as it relates to Google Cloud we continue to invest aggressively around the globe in our go-,
to-market  capabilities  product  development  and  technical  infrastructure  to  support  long  term  growth.  The  ongoing,
impact  of  COVID-19  and  the  extent  of  these  measures  we  have  taken  and  the  additional  measures  that  we  may,
implement  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  results.  Our  past  results  may  not  be  indicative  of  our  future,
performance and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially.,
Executive Overview,
,The  following  table  summarizes  our  consolidated  financial  results  for  the  years  ended  December  31  2019  and
2020 in millions except for per share information and percentages.,
