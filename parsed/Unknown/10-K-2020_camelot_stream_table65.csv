,We  record  our  marketable  equity  securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  at  fair  value  based  on,
readily  determinable  market  values  of  which  publicly  traded  stocks  and  mutual  funds  are  subject  to  market  price,,
volatility and represent 3.3 billion and 5.9 billion of our investments as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively.,,
A hypothetical adverse price change of 30 on our December 31 2020 balance which could be experienced in the,,
near term would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity securities by 1.8 billion. From time to time we may,,
enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.,,
,Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  are  adjusted  to  fair  value  for,
observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  or  impairment  referred  to  as  the,,
measurement  alternative.  The  fair  value  measured  at  the  time  of  the  observable  transaction  is  not  necessarily  an,,
indication  of  the  current  fair  value  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  These  investments  especially  those  that  are  in  the,,
early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are,,
typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which,,
could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any,,
private  company  is  also  typically  dependent  on  the  likelihood  of  our  ability  to  realize  appreciation  in  the  value  of  our,,
investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events. As of,,
December  31  2019  and  2020  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  which  were  accounted  for,,
under,the  measurement  alternative  was  11.4  billion  and  18.9  billion,respectively.  Valuations  of  our  equity
investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility,,
in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-,,
marketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with,,
changes  in  valuation  of  marketable  equity  securities.  Additionally  observable  transactions  at  lower  valuations  could,,
result,"in  significant 
losses  on  our  non-marketable  equity  securities.  The  effect  of  COVID-19  on  our",impairment
assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.,,
,The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion as,
of  December  31  2019  and  2020  respectively  generally  do  not  fluctuate  based  on  market  price  changes  however,,
these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.,,
