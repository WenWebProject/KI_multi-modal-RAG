Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information,,,,
,International  revenues  which  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  are  generally  transacted  in,,,
multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.,,,,
,The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period,,,
"comparisons.  We  use  non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ""constant  currency  revenues""  and  non-GAAP",,,,
percentage  change,"in  constant  currency  revenues  ""percentage  change",,"in  constant  currency  revenues""",for
financial  and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means  to  evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe,,,,
the  presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  GAAP  results  helps  improve  the  ability  to,,,,
understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of,,,,
our core operating results.,,,,
,Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant,,,
period  over  period.  We  define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency,,,,
"exchange  rate  movements  ""FX  Effect""  as  well  as  hedging  activities  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated",,,,
level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  on  a,,,,
year-on-year  basis.  Constant  currency  revenues  are  calculated  by  translating  current  period  revenues  using  prior,,,,
year comparable period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.,,,,
,Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period,,,
revenues  over  prior  year  comparable  period,revenues  where  current  period,,foreign  currency,revenues  are
translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of,,,,
both periods.,,,,
,These results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with,,,
GAAP.  Results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  as  we  present  them  may  not  be  comparable  to  similarly  titled,,,,
measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.,,,,
