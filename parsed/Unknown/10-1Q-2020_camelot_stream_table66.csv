mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will
result  in  the  anticipated  long-term  benefits.  In  the  event  that  our  users  are  adversely  affected  by  these  actions  or  if  our  relationships  with  such  third  parties

Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.
We compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are
designed to engage users on mobile devices and online. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate
communication  and  the  sharing  of  content  and  information  companies  that  enable  marketers  to  display  advertising  companies  that  distribute  video  and  other
forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. We compete with companies that offer products across
broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide. For example among other areas we compete with Apple in messaging Google and YouTube in advertising
and video Tencent and Snap in messaging and social media ytedance and Twitter in social media and Amazon in advertising. We also compete with companies
that  provide  regional  social  networks  and  messaging  products  many  of  which  have  strong  positions  in  particular  countries.  Some  of  our  competitors  may  be
domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. In addition we face
competition  from  traditional  online  and  mobile  businesses  that  provide  media  for  marketers  to  reach  their  audiences  and/or  develop  tools  and  systems  for
managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and
services.
Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions
or user demographics than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in
market conditions. We believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a
substitute for our products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these
other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in
key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed.
Our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far-reaching and
successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition developers whose mobile and web
applications  are  integrated  with Facebook  or our other  products  may  use  information  shared  by our users through  our products  in  order  to develop  products  or
features that compete with us. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including: by making acquisitions; by
limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our
products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms applications or features
into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or e-commerce platforms. For example each of Apple and Google
have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android respectively. As a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or
other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition from time to time we may take actions
in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial
results.
