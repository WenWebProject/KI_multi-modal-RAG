rise  drought  flooding  wildfires  and  increased  storm  severity  and  significant  changes  in  the  financial  or  business
condition of our suppliers. We have experienced and/or may in the future experience shortages or other supply chain
disruptions  that  could  negatively  affect  our  operations.  In  addition  some  of  the  components  we  use  in  our  technical
infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement
vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition a significant supply interruption could
delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.
We  may  enter  into  long  term  contracts  for  materials  and  products  that  commit  us  to  significant  terms  and

technological  change  obsolescences  quality  product  recalls  and  warranty  issues.  For  instance  because  certain  of
our  hardware  supply  contracts  have  volume-based  pricing  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  if  the  volume  of  our
hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing
costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect
our financial results. Furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on
volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.
"Our  products  and  services  may  have  quality 
issues 
resulting 
from  design  manufacturing  or  operations."
Sometimes  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other  manufacturers  or  suppliers.  If  the
quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective it could harm
our reputation financial condition and operating results.
We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies
"such  as 
the  Google  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  regarding  workplace  and  employment  practices  data  security"
environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of
law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key relationships
and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our
ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.
Interruption  interference  with  or  failure  of  our  complex  information  technology  and  communications
systems  could  hurt  our  ability  to  effectively  provide  our  products  and  services  which  could  harm  our
"reputation 
financial  condition  and  operating 
results. 
In  addition  complications  with 
the  design  or"
implementation  of  our  new  global  enterprise  resource  planning  system  could  harm  our  business  and
operations.
The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing

severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses ransomware attacks computer denial of service
attacks phishing schemes or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in
areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins
sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism  and  in  some  cases  to  potential  disruptions  resulting  from  problems
experienced by facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot
account for all eventualities.
The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID-19 closure of a facility or other unanticipated
problems at or impacting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition our products
"and  services  are  highly 
technical  and  complex  and  may  contain  errors  or  vulnerabilities  which  could  result 
in"
interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.
In addition we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize
operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which will replace much
of  our  existing  core  financial  systems.  The  ERP  system  is  designed  to  accurately  maintain  our  financial  records
"enhance 
the 
flow  of 
financial 
information 
improve  data  management  and  provide 
timely 
information 
to  our"
management  team.  We  may  not  be  able  to  successfully  implement  the  ERP  system  without  experiencing  delays
increased costs and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned
could harm our business financial condition and operating results. Additionally if we do not effectively implement the
ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting could be negatively affected.
