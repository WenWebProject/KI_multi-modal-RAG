,T,rends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of
our  ads  to  marketers  the  volume  of  Payments  transactions  as  well  as  our  expenses  and  capital  expenditures.  Substantially  all  of  our  daily  and  monthly  active,,
people as defined below access our Family products on mobile devices.,,
â€¢,,Daily Active People DAP. We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook Instagram Messenger and/or WhatsApp
,,"collectively our ""Family"" of products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile"
,,browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family and therefore
,,must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques
,,algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by
,,matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting
,,such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited
,,samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP and DAP
,,"as a percentage of MAP as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics"
,,"and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
