Overview
"As  our  founders  Larry  and  Sergey  wrote  in  the  original  founders'  letter  ""Google  is  not  a  conventional  company."
"We do not intend to become one."" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring"
us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence AI research and quantum computing. We
continue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO
of Alphabet since 2019.
Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other ets. Other ets
include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long-term view and
manage  the  portfolio  of  Other  ets  with  the  discipline  and  rigor  needed  to  deliver  long-term  returns.  Alphabet's
structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.
Access and technology for everyone
The  Internet  is  one  of  the  world’s  most  powerful  equalizers;  it  propels  ideas  people  and  businesses  large  and
small.  Our  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful  is  as  relevant
today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find
answers to a company that also helps people get things done.
We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools
they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success. Every year there are trillions of searches on
Google and 15 of the searches we see every day are new. We continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies
to ensure the most helpful search experience possible. YouTube provides people with entertainment information and
opportunities to learn something new. And Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across
different devices providing intelligent help throughout a person's day no matter where they are.
We are continually innovating and building new product features that will help our users partners customers and
communities. We have invested more than 100 billion in R&D over the last five years. In addition with the onset of
