Moonshots,,,
,Many  companies  get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done  making  only  incremental  changes.  This,,
incrementalism  leads  to  irrelevance  over  time  especially  in  technology  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary  not,,,
evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,,,
but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser.,,,
We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the,,,
original founders' letter we will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects that we believe in as they are the,,,
key to our long-term success.,,,
The power of AI,,,
,We  believe  that  AI  is  a  foundational  and  transformational  technology  that  will  provide  compelling  and  helpful,,
benefits to people and society through its capacity to assist complement empower and inspire people in almost every,,,
field of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company we will continue to be at the forefront of,,,
advancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development we responsibly,,,
and boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day.,,,
,AI already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of,,
our  core  ads  quality  systems  for  years  helping  large  and  small  businesses  all  over  the  world  to  produce  and  run,,,
effective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages,,,
with multiple inputs such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular,,,
products at Google — including Lens and Translate — were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such,,,
as optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that,,,
our customers can use to develop AI-powered applications — including processing documents images and translation,,,
—  to  understand  and  analyze  data  more  efficiently  and  to  use  packaged  solutions  for  a  variety  of  industries.  In  all,,,
these  examples AI  significantly  enhances  the  usefulness  and  multiplies  the  value  of  these  products  and  services  to,,,
people and organizations.,,,
,Our view is that AI is now and more than ever critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough,,
AI  innovations  into  the  real  world  to  assist  people  and  benefit  society  everywhere  we  are  also  pursuing  further,,,
"advancements 
that  will  help",to  unlock  scientific  discoveries  and,to,tackle  humanity's  greatest  challenges  and
opportunities.,,,
Privacy and security,,,
,We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products users and customers even if there are,,
near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;,,,
strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that,,,
put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time whether by enabling users to auto-delete,,,
their  data  giving  them  new  tools  such  as  My Ad  Center  to  control  their  ad  experience  or  advancing  anti-malware,,,
anti-phishing and password security features.,,,
Google,,,
,For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.,,
Google Services,,,
Serving our users,,,
,We  have  always  been  committed  to  building  helpful  products  that  can  improve  the  lives  of  millions  of  people,,
worldwide.  Our  product,,innovations  are  what  make  our  services  widely  used  and  our  brand  one  of,the  most
recognized  in  the  world.  Google  Services'  core  products  and  platforms  include  ads  Android  Chrome  hardware,,,
Gmail  Google  Drive  Google  Maps  Google  Photos  Google  Play  Search  and  YouTube  with  broad  and  growing,,,
adoption by users around the world.,,,
,Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.,,
Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results users can now get direct answers to their questions using,,,
their computer or mobile device their own voice a photo or an image making it quicker easier and more natural to,,,
find what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every day 15 are new.,,,
,This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery,,
and  creation  of  digital  content  both  on  the  web  and  through  platforms  like  Google  Play  and  YouTube.  People  are,,,
consuming many forms of digital content including watching videos playing games listening to music reading books,,,
