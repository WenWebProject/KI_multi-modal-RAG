Through our products we have an aspiration to help individuals cities and other partners collectively reduce one
gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.
In  2021  we  set  an  ambitious  goal  to  reach  net-zero  emissions  across  all  of  our  operations  and  value  chain  by
2030. To make progress toward this effort we aim to reduce 50 of our combined Scope 1 Scope 2 market-based
and Scope 3 absolute emissions compared to our 2019 base year by 2030 and we plan to invest in nature-based
and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.
Our  primary  approach  to  reducing  our  Scope  2  emissions  is  through  the  procurement  of  carbon-free  energy
CFE. In 2020 we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In
2023 we began implementing our carbon removals strategy and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships
and have started contracting for carbon removal credits.
Achieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path
to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results particularly where
they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will
require  us  to  navigate  significant  uncertainty  including  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  environmental  impact  of AI
which  is  complex  and  difficult  to  predict.  In  addition  solutions  for  some  key  global  challenges  do  not  currently  exist
and will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As
our business and industry continue to evolve we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our
absolute emissions reduction target.
