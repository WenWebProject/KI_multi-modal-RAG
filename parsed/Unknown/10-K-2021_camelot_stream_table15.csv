,We  also  seek  to  maintain  certain  intellectual  property  as  trade  secrets.  The  secrecy  of  such  trade  secrets  and,,,
other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting,,,,
from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example there is a risk that the word,,,,
“Google”  could  become  so  commonly  used  that  it  becomes  synonymous  with  the  word  “search.”  Some  courts  have,,,,
"ruled that ""Google"" is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the U.S.",,,,
may reach a different determination. If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in,,,,
other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand.,,,,
,Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.,,,
Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of,,,,
our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.,,,,
,Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our,,,
ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners.,,,,
,Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the,,,
brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch,,,,
new  and  innovative  products  and  services  that  better  serve  the  needs  of  our  users  advertisers  customers  content,,,,
providers  and  other  partners.  Our  brands  have  been  and  may  in  the  future  be  negatively  affected  by  a  number  of,,,,
factors  including  among  others  reputational  issues  third-party  content  shared  on  our  platforms  data  privacy  and,,,,
security  issues  and  developments  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example  if  we  fail  to  respond,,,,
appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable,,,,
practices  by  advertisers  or  otherwise  to  adequately  address  user  concerns  our  users  may  lose  confidence  in  our,,,,
brands.,,,,
,Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business financial condition and,,,
operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide,,,,
high-quality  trustworthy  innovative  products  and  services  that  are  truly  useful  and  play  a  valuable  role  in  a  range  of,,,,
settings.,,,,
,We  face  a  number  of  manufacturing  and  supply  chain  risks  that  could  harm  our  financial  condition,,,
operating results and prospects.,,,,
,We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability,,,
to supply both our products and our internet-based services.,,,,
,We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products; to design certain of our components,,,
and  parts;  to  participate  in  the  distribution  of  our  products  and  services;  and  to  design  manufacture  or  assemble,,,,
certain components and parts in our technical infrastructure. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not,,,,
able  to  engage  these  companies  with  the  necessary  capabilities  or  capacity  on  reasonable  terms  or  if  those  we,,,,
engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in,,,,
the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.,,,,
,We  have  experienced  and/or  may  in  the  future  experience  supply  shortages  and/or  price  increases  that  could,,,
negatively  affect  our  operations  driven  by  raw  material  component  or  part  availability  manufacturing  capacity  labor,,,,
shortages  industry  allocations  logistics  capacity  tariffs  trade  disputes  and  barriers  natural  disasters  or  pandemics,,,,
the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality,,,,
effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity and significant changes,,,,
in  the  financial  or  business  condition  of  our  suppliers.  In  addition  some  of  the  components  we  use  in  our  technical,,,,
infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement,,,,
vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition a significant supply interruption that,,,,
affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.,,,,
,We  may  enter  into  long-term  contracts  for  materials  and  products  that  commit  us  to  significant  terms  and,,,
conditions.  We  may  be,liable,for  materials  and  products,that  are  not  consumed  due,to  market  acceptance
technological  change  obsolescences  quality  product  recalls  and  warranty  issues.  For  instance  because  certain  of,,,,
our  hardware  supply  contracts  have  volume-based  pricing  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  if  the  volume  of  our,,,,
hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing,,,,
costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect,,,,
our financial results. Furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on,,,,
volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.,,,,
