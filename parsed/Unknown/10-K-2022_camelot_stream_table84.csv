,As of December 31 2021 and 2022 equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value,,
of approximately 1.5 billion for both years. Our share of gains and losses including impairments are included as a,,,
component of other income expense net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details,,,
on other income expense net.,,,
Derivative Financial Instruments,,,
,We  use  derivative  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  our  ongoing  business  operations.  The  primary  risk,,
managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows earnings,,,
and  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries  will  be  adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We,,,
also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.,,,
,We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated alance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives,,
primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts an option strategy comprised of a,,,
combination of purchased and written options at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values.,,,
The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.,,,
Cash Flow Hedges,,,
,We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  including  collars  as  cash  flow  hedges  to  hedge,,
certain  forecasted  revenue  transactions  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar. These  contracts  have,,,
maturities of 24 months or less.,,,
"Cash 
flow  hedge  amounts",included,"in 
the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred",in  AOCI  and
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and,,,
time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the,,,
hedging  instrument  in  revenues.  The  difference  between  fair  value  changes  of  the  excluded  component  and  the,,,
amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.,,,
,As of December 31 2022 the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect,,
was 171 million which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.,,,
Fair Value Hedges,,,
,We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our,,
marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the,,,
assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income expense net along with the offsetting gains and,,,
losses  of  the  related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and,,,
recognize changes in the excluded component in other income expense net.,,,
Net Investment Hedges,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks,,
related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge,,,
effectiveness  are  recognized  in  AOCI  along  with  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment.  We  exclude  forward,,,
points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income,,,
expense net.,,,
Other Derivatives,,,
,We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  that  are  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to,,
hedge  intercompany  transactions  and  other  monetary  assets  or  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the,,,
functional  currency  of  a  subsidiary.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  derivatives  that  are  not  designated  as  accounting,,,
hedges  are  primarily  recorded  in  other  income  expense  net  along  with  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  on,,,
monetary assets and liabilities.,,,
,We  also  use  derivatives  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  interest  rates,,
commodity prices credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. From time to time we enter into derivatives to,,,
hedge  the  market  price  risk  on  certain  of  our  marketable  equity  securities.  Gains  and  losses  arising  from  other,,,
derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of other income expense net. See Note 7 for further,,,
details.,,,
