"Cash 
flow  hedge  amounts","included 
in 
the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred",in  AOCI  and
subsequently  reclassified  to  revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  the  change  in,,
forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component,,
is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference,,
between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If,,
the  hedged  transactions  become  probable  of  not  occurring  the  corresponding  amounts  in  AOCI  are  reclassified  to,,
other income expense net in the period of de-designation.,,

was 124 million which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.,,
