We are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming
and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations.
Companies in the Internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter
"into  litigation  based  on  allegations  of  infringement  misappropriation  or  other  violations  of  intellectual  property  or  other  rights.  In  addition  various  ""non-"
"practicing entities"" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology"
companies. Furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could
increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.
From time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their
intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly
high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is
costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all
cases. In addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential
preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us.
Similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The
terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition we may
have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may
significantly  increase  our  operating  costs  and  expenses.  As  a  result  we  may  also  be  required  to  develop  alternative  non-infringing  technology  or  practices  or
discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense could result in less
effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such
disputes  and  litigation  in  the  past  and  our  business  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected  as  a  result  of  an  unfavorable
resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.
We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm
our business financial condition or results of operations.
In addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim
statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the
future. ecause of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-
user harm is small or non-existent. In addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on advertiser claims
antitrust  claims  employment  claims  product  performance  or  other  claims  related  to  the  use  of  consumer  hardware  and  software  as  well  as  virtual  reality
technology and products which are new and unproven. For example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our
platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well
as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018. We also recently agreed to settlements in principle to resolve certain lawsuits in connection
"with  the  ""tag  suggestions""  facial  recognition  feature  on  Facebook  and  a  third-party  cyber-attack  that  exploited  a  vulnerability  in  Facebook's  code  to  steal  user"
access  tokens  and  access  certain  profile  information  from  user  accounts  on  Facebook.  We  believe  the  remaining  lawsuits  are  without  merit  and  are  vigorously
defending them. However the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result
in  payments  of  substantial  monetary  damages  or  fines  or  undesirable  changes  to  our  products  or  business  practices  and  accordingly  our  business  financial
condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant
burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon
appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which has occurred in the past
and which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations.
