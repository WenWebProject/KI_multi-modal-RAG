Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical
variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our
worldwide MAP. At our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique
"people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information see the section entitled ""Limitations of"
"Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
Worldwide DAP increased 12 to 2.36 billion on average during March 2020 from 2.10 billion during March 2019.
