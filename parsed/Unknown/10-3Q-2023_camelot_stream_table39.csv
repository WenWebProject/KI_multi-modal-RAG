Communications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new
regulations. We intend to respond in November 2023.
We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate
with federal and state regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that
certain  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights. Adverse  results  in
these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or
orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have
to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition the U.S. International Trade Commission ITC has
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC
action  can  result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing  infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  ecause  the  U.S.  is  an  important
market  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  including  preventing  us  from  importing
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  which  would  increase  our  costs  as  a  result  of  defending  such
claims  and  may  require  that  we  pay  significant  damages  if  there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  In
addition  our  customers  and  partners  may  discontinue  the  use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a
result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

have  a  number  of  privacy  investigations  and  lawsuits  ongoing  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  We  also  periodically  have
data  incidents  that  we  report  to  relevant  regulators  as  required  by  law.  Such  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and

We  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding
penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts including
those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.
Non-Income Taxes
We  are  under  audit  by  various  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities  with  regards  to  non-income  tax  matters.
The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We
accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by  or  any  negotiated  agreements  with  these  tax
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and
the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity
