Revenues
For the sale of third-party goods and services we evaluate whether we are the principal and report revenues on
a gross basis or an agent and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment we consider if we obtain control of
the  specified  goods  or  services  before  they  are  transferred  to  the  customer  as  well  as  other  indicators  such  as  the
party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in establishing price.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating
our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that
the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  will  not  be  different.  We  adjust  these  reserves  in  light  of  changing  facts  and
circumstances  such  as  the  closing  of  a  tax  audit  or  the  refinement  of  an  estimate.  To  the  extent  that  the  final  tax
outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income
taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
The  provision  for  income  taxes  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are
considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition we are subject to the continuous
"examination  of  our  income  tax  returns  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Services  ""IRS""  and  other  tax  authorities  which  may"
"assert  assessments  against  us.  We 
regularly  assess 
the 
likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes 
resulting 
from 
these"
examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Loss Contingencies
We are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition
"intellectual  property  privacy 
tax  and 
related  compliance 
labor  and  employment  commercial  disputes  content"
generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury
"consumer  protection  and  other  matters.  Certain  of 
these  matters 
include  speculative  claims 
for  substantial  or"
indeterminate  amounts  of  damages.  We  record  a  liability  when  we  believe  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss
or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has
been  previously  accrued  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed  and  make  adjustments
and  changes  to  our  disclosures  as  appropriate.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  the  likelihood  of
there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters there
may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material. Should any of our
estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived  assets  including  property  and  equipment  long-term  prepayments  and  intangible  assets  excluding
goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  evaluation  is  performed  at  the  lowest  level  of  identifiable  cash  flows
independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows
generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on
the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.
Fair Value Measurements
We  measure  certain  of  our  non-marketable  equity  and  debt  investments  certain  other  instruments  including
stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other ets and certain assets and liabilities acquired
in  a  business  combination  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of
appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs
used  to  measure  fair  value  whereby  it  gives  the  highest  priority  to  quoted  prices  unadjusted  in  active  markets  for
identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. We maximize the use of relevant observable
inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs.  Our  use  of  unobservable  inputs  reflects  the  assumptions  that
market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available information. We
apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the fair
value hierarchy particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity.
