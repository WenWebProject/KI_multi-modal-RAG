10.3    Value Earning and Timing of Performance Shares. Any Performance Share bonus will have an initial value equal to
the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. After the applicable Performance Period has ended the holder of a Performance Share
bonus will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period to be determined as
a function of the extent to which the corresponding Performance Factors or other vesting provisions have been achieved. The Committee in
its sole discretion may pay an earned Performance Share bonus in the form of cash in Shares which have an aggregate Fair Market Value
equal  to  the  value  of  the  earned  Performance  Shares  at  the  close  of  the  applicable  Performance  Period  or  in  a  combination  thereof.
Performance Share bonuses may also be settled in Restricted Stock.
10.4    Termination. Except as may be set forth in the Participant’s Award Agreement vesting ceases on such Participant’s
Termination Date unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
