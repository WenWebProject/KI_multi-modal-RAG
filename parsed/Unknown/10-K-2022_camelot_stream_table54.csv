,If  an  adverse  10  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  total  monetary  assets  liabilities  and,,
commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have,,,
resulted  in  an  adverse  effect  on  income  before  income  taxes  of  approximately  285  million  and  136  million  as  of,,,
December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for,,,
the years ended December 31 2021 and 2022.,,,
,We  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  including  collars  an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a,,
combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in,,,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  When  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens  gains  from  foreign  currency  forward  and  option,,,
contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens losses from foreign,,,
currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These  hedging,,,
contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate,,,
these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot,,,
rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassify them,,,
into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.,,,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2021 and 2022 the amount recorded in AOCI related to,,
our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 1.3 billion lower for both December 31 2021,,,
and  2022. The  change  in  the  value  recorded  in AOCI  would  be  expected  to  offset  a  corresponding  foreign  currency,,,
change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.,,,
,We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency,,
risks  related  to  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  These  forward  contracts  serve  to  offset  the  foreign  currency,,,
translation risk from our foreign operations.,,,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment CTA within AOCI,,
related to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 975 million and 903 million,,,
lower as of December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to,,,
offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.,,,
Interest Rate Risk,,,
,Our  Corporate  Treasury  investment  strategy  is  to  achieve  a  return  that  will  allow  us  to  preserve  capital  and,,
"maintain 
liquidity.  We",invest  primarily,in  debt  securities,including  government  bonds  corporate  debt  securities
mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities  money  market  and  other,,funds,"time  deposits  and 
interest  rate"
derivatives. y policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and,,,
floating  rate  interest  earning  securities  carry  a  degree  of  interest  rate  risk.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  fair,,,
market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income,,,
than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to,,,
interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt,,,
securities  we  have  elected  the  fair  value  option  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  are  recorded  in  other  income,,,
expense net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and,,,
losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold less any expected credit losses.,,,
,We use value-at-risk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value,,
of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for,,,
our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with,,,
95 confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31,,,
2021 and 2022 are shown below in millions:,,,
