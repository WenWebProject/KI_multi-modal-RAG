Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability
At  Google  we  build  technology  that  helps  people  do  more  for  the  planet.  We  strive  to  build  sustainability  into
everything  we  do  including  designing  and  operating  efficient  data  centers  advancing  carbon-free  energy  creating
sustainable  workplaces  building  better  devices  and  services  empowering  users  with  technology  and  enabling  a
responsible supply chain.
Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and in 2019 for the third consecutive year we matched 100 of our
electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases. We are the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable
energy in the world based on renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hour MWh. In 2020 we neutralized our
entire  legacy  carbon  footprint  since  our  founding  covering  all  our  operational  emissions  before  we  became  carbon
neutral in 2007 making Google the first major company to achieve carbon neutrality for its entire operating history. In
our third decade of climate action we’ve set our most ambitious goal yet: to run our business on carbon-free energy
everywhere at all times by 2030.
We're also investing in technologies to help our partners and people all over the world make sustainable choices.
For  example  we  intend  to  enable  5  GW  of  new  carbon-free  energy  across  our  key  manufacturing  regions  by  2030
through investment. We anticipate this will spur more than 5 billion in clean energy investments avoid the amount of
emissions equal to taking more than 1 million cars off the road each year and create more than 8000 clean energy
jobs. With the Environmental Insights Explorer we're also working to help more than 500 cities and local governments
globally reduce a total of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030 — that’s the equivalent of the annual carbon
emissions of a country the size of Japan.
Google’s products are already helping people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives whether it’s using
Google Maps to find bike-shares and electric vehicle charging stations or in many European countries using Google
Flights to sort the least carbon-intensive option flights. There are more tools and information we can provide and our
goal is to find new ways that our products can help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022.
Climate  change  is  one  of  the  most  significant  global  challenges  of  our  time.  In  2017  we  developed  a  climate
resilience strategy which included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We've earned a spot on the CDP formerly
the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project  Climate  Change  A  List  for  seven  consecutive  years.  We  believe  our  CDP  climate
change response reflects the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD.
In 2020 we issued 5.75 billion in sustainability bonds the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any
company  in  history.  The  net  proceeds  from  the  issuance  are  used  to  fund  environmentally  and  socially  responsible
projects  in  the  following  eight  areas:  energy  efficiency  clean  energy  green  buildings  clean  transportation  circular
economy and design affordable housing commitment to racial equity and support for small businesses and COVID-19
crisis response.
More  information  on  our  approach  to  sustainability  can  be  found  in  our  annual  sustainability  reports  including
Google’s  environmental  report.  The  content  of  our  sustainability  reports  are  not  incorporated  by  reference  into  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.
