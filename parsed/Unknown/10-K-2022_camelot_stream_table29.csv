,Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions,,,,
and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities,,,,,
and harm our business generally.,,,,,
,Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the,,,,
incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-,,,,,
lived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also the,,,,,
anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with,,,,,
our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities,,,,,
which could harm our financial condition and operating results.,,,,,
,If we were to lose the services of key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy.,,,,
,Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management,,,,
team. For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an,,,,,
important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of,,,,,
our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance,,,,,
policies. The loss of key personnel could harm our business.,,,,,
,We  rely  on  highly  skilled  personnel  and  if  we  are  unable  to  retain  or  motivate  key  personnel  hire,,,,
qualified personnel or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture we may not be able to grow or,,,,,
operate effectively.,,,,,
,Our  performance  largely  depends  on  the  talents  and  efforts  of  highly  skilled  individuals.  Our  ability  to  compete,,,,
effectively  and  our  future  success  depends  on  our  continuing  to  identify  hire  develop  motivate  and  retain  highly,,,,,
skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and,,,,,
certain  of  our  competitors  have  directly,,"targeted  and  may  continue 
to",target  our  employees.,,In  addition  our
compensation  arrangements  such  as  our  equity  award  programs  may  not  always  be  successful  in  attracting  new,,,,,
employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes,,,,,
may also affect our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent.,,,,,
,In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork. As our organization,,,,
grows  and  evolves  we  may  need  to  implement  more  complex  organizational  management  structures  or  adapt  our,,,,,
corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or,,,,,
pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate,,,,,
culture. As we experiment with hybrid work models we may experience increased costs and/or disruption in addition,,,,,
to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.,,,,,
