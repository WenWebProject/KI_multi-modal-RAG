Property and Equipment,,,,,
,Property  and  equipment  includes  the  following  categories:  land  and  buildings  information  technology  assets,,,,
construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land offices,,,,,
data  centers  and,related  building,improvements.,Information,technology  assets,include  servers  and  network
equipment. We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation,,,,,
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which we regularly evaluate. We depreciate,,,,,
buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four,,,,,
to five years generally four years for servers and five years for network equipment.,,,,,
,We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives,,,,
of the assets. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet,,,,,
been  placed  in  service  for  our  intended  use.  Depreciation  for  equipment  buildings  and  leasehold  improvements,,,,,
commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.,,,,,
Leases,,,,,
,We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-,,,,
lease  components.  Payments  under  our  lease  arrangements  are  primarily  fixed.  Non-lease  components  primarily,,,,,
include  payments  for  maintenance  and  utilities.  We  combine  fixed  payments  for  non-lease  components  with  lease,,,,,
payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets,,,,,
and liabilities.,,,,,
,Certain  lease  agreements  contain  variable  payments  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  not  included  in  the,,,,
lease  assets  and  liabilities.  These  amounts  include  payments  affected  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  payments,,,,,
contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements and payments for maintenance and utilities.,,,,,
,Lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  at  the  lease,,,,
commencement  date.  The  interest  rate  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  is  our,,,,,
incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental,,,,,
borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,,,,,
and  in  economic  environments  where  the  leased  asset  is  located.  Our  lease  terms  include  periods  under  options  to,,,,,
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base,,,,,
non-cancelable  lease  term  when  determining  the  lease  assets  and  liabilities.  Lease  assets  also  include  any  prepaid,,,,,
lease payments and lease incentives.,,,,,
,Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated alance Sheet. The current portion of our,,,,
operating  lease  liabilities  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  and  the  long-term  portion  is,,,,,
included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net. Finance lease,,,,,
liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.,,,,,
,Operating  lease  expense  excluding  variable  lease  costs  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease,,,,
term.,,,,,
Long-Lived Assets Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets,,,,,
,We  review  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  excluding  goodwill  for  impairment  when  events  or,,,,
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  evaluation  is  performed  at  the,,,,,
lowest  level  of  identifiable  cash  flows  independent  of  other  assets.  We  measure  recoverability  of  these  assets  by,,,,,
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected,,,,,
to  generate.  If  the  carrying  value  of  the  assets  or  asset  group  is  not  recoverable  the  impairment  recognized  is,,,,,
measured  as  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Impairments  were  not  material  for  the,,,,,
periods presented.,,,,,
,We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate,,,,
our  reporting  units  periodically  as  well  as  when  changes  in  our  operating  segments  occur.  For  changes  in  reporting,,,,,
units we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least,,,,,
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill,,,,,
impairments were not material for the periods presented.,,,,,
,Intangible  assets  with  definite  lives  are  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  on  a  straight-line  basis,,,,
generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years.,,,,,
