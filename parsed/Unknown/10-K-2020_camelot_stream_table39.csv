•,The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect
margins.,
,Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our
offerings to our users through products and services like Google Cloud Google Play hardware products and YouTube,
subscriptions.  Across  these  initiatives  we  currently  derive  non-advertising  revenues  primarily  from  sales  of  apps  in-,
app  purchases  digital  content  products  and  hardware;  and  licensing  and  service  fees  including  fees  received  for,
Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and may,
be  lower  than  the  margins  on  our  advertising  revenues.  A  number  of  our  Other  ets  initiatives  are  in  their  initial,
development  stages  and  as  such  the  sources  of  revenues  from  these  businesses  could  change  over  time  and  the,
revenues could be volatile.,
•,As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and
capital expenditures.,
,We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising cloud machine
learning and search as well as in new products and services. In addition we expect to continue to invest in land and,
buildings,"for  data  centers  and  offices  and 
information 
technology  assets  which 
includes  servers  and  network"
equipment to support the long-term growth of our business.,
,In  addition  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments  are  an  important  part  of  our  strategy  and  use  of  capital
contributing  to  the  breadth  and  depth  of  our  offerings  expanding  our  expertise  in  engineering  and  other  functional,
areas and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example in 2020 we announced our Google for,
India  Digitization  Fund  to  invest  approximately  10  billion  into  India  over  the  next  5-7  years  through  a  mix  of  equity,
investments partnerships and operational infrastructure and ecosystem investments.,
•,We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions laws and public policies which could impact our
business practices and financial results.,
,Changes  in  social  political  economic  tax  and  regulatory  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  a  wide
range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As,
these global trends continue for example the recent antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a,
number of state Attorneys General as well as the News Media argaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition,
and Consumer Commission our cost of doing business may increase and our ability to pursue certain business models,
or offer certain products or services may be limited.,
•,Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.
,Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring
talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.,
The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and Operations,
,In late 2019 an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11 2020 was declared a global pandemic by the
World  Health  Organization.  Across,"the  United  States  and 
the  world  governments  and  municipalities 
instituted"
measures,"in  an  effort 
to  control 
the  spread  of  COVID-19 
including  quarantines  shelter-in-place  orders  school"
closings travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. The macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are,
significant and continue to evolve as exhibited by among other things a rise in unemployment changes in consumer,
behavior and market volatility.,
,We  began  to  observe  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  the  related  reductions  in  global  economic  activity  on  our
financial results in March 2020 when despite an increase in users' search activity our advertising revenues declined,
compared to the prior year due to a shift of user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our,
advertisers. During the course of the quarter ended June 30 2020 we observed a gradual return in user search activity,
to  more  commercial  topics  followed  by  increased  spending  by  our  advertisers  that  continued  throughout  the  second,
half of 2020.,
,We  continue  to  assess  the  realized  and  potential  credit  deterioration  of  our  customers  due  to  changes  in  the
macroeconomic  environment  which  has  been  reflected  in  our  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  accounts  receivable.,
Additionally over the course of the year we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less,
variable in nature and/or may not correlate to changes in revenues including costs associated with our data centers,
and facilities as well as employee compensation. Also market volatility has contributed to fluctuations in the valuation,
of our equity investments.,
