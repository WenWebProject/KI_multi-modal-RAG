Various legislative litigation and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business"
model which could result in monetary penalties damages and/or prohibition.
"•
Various  legislative  and  regulatory  activity  requiring  disclosure  of  information  about  the  operation  of  our"
services and algorithms which may make it easier for websites to artificially promote low-quality deceptive
or  harmful  content  on  services  like  Google  Search  and  YouTube  potentially  harming  the  quality  of  our
services.
In addition the applicability and scope of these and other laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain
and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example:
"•
We rely on statutory  safe harbors like  those  set  forth in  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section"
230  of  the  Communications  Decency  Act  in  the  U.S.  and  the  E-Commerce  Directive  in  Europe  against
liability for various linking caching ranking recommending and hosting activities. Any legislation or court
"rulings  affecting 
these  safe  harbors  may  adversely  affect  us  and  may 
impose  significant  operational"
challenges.  There  are  legislative  proposals  and  pending  litigation  in  both  the  U.S.  such  as  Gonzalez  v.
Google and EU that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.
"•
Court  decisions  such  as  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  CJEU  on  May  13"
2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results
about  them  in  certain  instances  may  limit  the  content  we  can  show  to  our  users  and  impose  significant
operational burdens.
The introduction of new businesses products services and technologies our activities in certain jurisdictions
or other actions we take have subjected us and will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations.
Our  investment  in  a  variety  of  new  fields  such  as  healthcare  and  payment  services  has  expanded  and  will
continue to expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws
and  regulations  are  high  and  are  likely  to  increase  in  the  future. Any  failure  on  our  part  to  comply  with  laws  and
regulations  can  result  in  negative  publicity  and  diversion  of  management  time  and  effort  and  may  subject  us  to
significant liabilities and other penalties.
