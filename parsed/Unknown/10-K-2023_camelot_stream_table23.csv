Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers which could"
result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.
In  addition  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations  as  interpreted  by  courts
regulators  or  administrative  bodies  remain  uncertain  and  could  be  interpreted  in  ways  that  harm  our  business.  For
example we rely on statutory safe harbors like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230
of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe to protect against liability for
various linking caching ranking recommending and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe
harbors  may  adversely  affect  us  and  may  impose  significant  operational  challenges. There  are  legislative  proposals
and pending litigation in the U.S. EU and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for
websites  and  online  platforms.  Our  development  use  and  commercialization  of AI  products  and  services  including
our implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability
including under specific legislation regulating AI as well as new applications of existing data protection cybersecurity
privacy intellectual property and other laws.
We  are  and  may  continue  to  be  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  investigations
