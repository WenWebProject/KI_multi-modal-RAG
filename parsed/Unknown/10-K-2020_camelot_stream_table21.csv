known as “web spam” may affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading or,,,,,
undesirable content.,,,,,
,Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been  reduced  and  web  spam  in  most  other,,,,
languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We,,,,,
continuously  combat  web  spam  in  our  search  results  including  through  indexing  technology  that  makes  it  harder  for,,,,,
spam-like less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to,,,,,
detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms.,,,,,
,We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are,,,,
websites  that  generate  large  quantities  of  low-quality  content  to  help  them  improve  their  search  rankings.  We  are,,,,,
continually launching algorithmic changes focused on detecting and preventing abuse from low-quality websites.,,,,,
,We also face other challenges on our platforms including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents,,,,
such as attempted election interference activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or offline,,,,,
and the spreading of disinformation among other challenges.,,,,,
,If  we  fail  to  either  detect  and  prevent  an  increase  in  problematic  content  or  effectively  promote  high-quality,,,,
content  it  could  hurt  our  reputation  for  delivering  relevant  information  or  reduce  use  of  our  platforms  harming  our,,,,,
financial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in,,,,,
monetary penalties and damages divert management’s time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.,,,,,
,Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet,,,,
access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and,,,,,
services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.,,,,,
,Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products,,,,
require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently this access is provided by companies that have significant,,,,,
market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access  marketplace  including  incumbent  telephone  companies  cable,,,,,
companies  mobile  communications  companies  and  government-owned  service  providers.  Some  of  these  providers,,,,,
have  taken  or  have  stated  that  they  may  take  measures  that  could  degrade  disrupt  or  increase  the  cost  of  user,,,,,
access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our,,,,,
offerings  by  charging  increased  fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  provide  our  offerings  or  by  providing  our  competitors,,,,,
preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet,,,,,
access  providers;  however  substantial  uncertainty  exists,,in,the  United  States  and  elsewhere,,regarding  such
protections.  For  example  in  2018  the  United  States  Federal  Communications  Commission  repealed  net  neutrality,,,,,
rules  which  could  permit  internet  access  providers  to  restrict  block  degrade  or  charge  for  access  to  certain  of  our,,,,,
products and services. In addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to government-,,,,,
initiated restrictions or blockages. COVID-19 has also resulted in quarantines shelter in place orders and work from,,,,,
home directives all of which have increased demands for internet access and may create access challenges. These,,,,,
could result in a loss of existing users customers and advertisers goodwill and increased costs and could impair our,,,,,
ability to attract new users customers and advertisers thereby harming our business.,,,,,
,Risks Related to Laws and Regulations,,,,
,We  face  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  as  well  as  changes  in  regulatory  conditions  laws  and  policies,,,,
governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business.,,,,,
,We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and,,,,
other proceedings. For instance the U.S. Department of Justice joined by a number of state Attorneys General filed,,,,,
an antitrust complaint against Google on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to,,,,,
Search  and  Search  advertising.  Separately  on  December  16  2020  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  filed  an,,,,,
antitrust  complaint  against  Google  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Texas  alleging  that,,,,,
Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Various,,,,,
other  regulatory  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  around  the  world  including  competition  enforcers  consumer,,,,,
protection  agencies  data  protection  authorities  grand  juries  inter-agency  consultative  groups  and  a  range  of  other,,,,,
governmental  bodies  have  and  continue  to  review  our  products  and  services  and  their  compliance  with  laws  and,,,,,
regulations  around,the  world.  We  continue,to  cooperate  with,these,investigations.  Various,"laws 
regulations"
investigations enforcement lawsuits and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial,,,,,
fines and penalties injunctive relief ongoing auditing and monitoring,,,,,
