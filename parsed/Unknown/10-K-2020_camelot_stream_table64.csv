December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for,
the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020.,
,We  use  foreign  currency  forwards  and  option  contracts  including  collars  an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a
combination of purchased and written options to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes,
in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  When  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens  gains  from  foreign  currency  options  and,
forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens losses from foreign,
currency  collars  and  forwards  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These  hedging  contracts,
reduce  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements.  We  designate  these,
contracts  as  cash  flow  hedges  for  accounting  purposes.  We  reflect  the  gains  or  losses  of  foreign  currency  spot  rate,
changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as,
they occur.,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2019 and 2020 the amount recorded in AOCI related to
our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 1.1 billion and 912 million lower as,
of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a,
corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.,
,We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency
risks  related  to  our  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  These  forward  contracts  serve  to  offset  the  foreign  currency,
translation risk from our foreign operations.,
,"If  the  U.S.  dollar  weakened  by  10  the  amount  recorded  in  cumulative  translation  adjustment  ""CTA""  within"
AOCI  related  to  our  net  investment  hedge  would  have  been  approximately  936  million  and  1  billion  lower  as  of,
December  31  2019  and  2020  respectively.  The  change  in  value  recorded  in  CTA  would  be  expected  to  offset  a,
corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.,
Interest Rate Risk,
,Our  Corporate  Treasury  investment  strategy  is  to  achieve  a  return  that  will  allow  us  to  preserve  capital  and
maintain  liquidity.  We  invest  primarily  in  debt  securities  including  those  of  the  U.S.  government  and  its  agencies,
corporate  debt  securities  mortgage-backed  securities  money  market  and  other  funds  municipal  securities  time,
deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. y policy we limit the amount,
of  credit  exposure  to  any  one  issuer.  Our  investments  in  both  fixed  rate  and  floating  rate  interest  earning  securities,
carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a,
rise  in  interest  rates  while  floating  rate  securities  may  produce  less  income  than  predicted  if  interest  rates  fall.,
Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared,
to  interest  rates  at  the  time  of  purchase.  For  certain  fixed  and  variable  rate  debt  securities  we  have  elected  the  fair,
value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net. We measure securities for,
which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities,
are sold less any expected credit losses.,
,"We use value-at-risk ""VaR"" analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value"
of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for,
our  investment  portfolio  due  to  adverse  movements  in  interest  rates.  We  use  a  variance/covariance  VaR  model  with,
95 confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31,
2019 and 2020 are shown below in millions:,
