"The 
total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized",tax  benefits  was  3.4  billion  3.8  billion  and  5.2  billion  as  of,,,,,
December  31  2019  2020  and  2021  respectively  of  which  2.3  billion  2.6  billion  and  3.7  billion  if  recognized,,,,,,
would affect our effective tax rate respectively.,,,,,,
,As  of  December  31  2020  and  2021  we  accrued  222  million  and  270  million  in  interest  and  penalties  in,,,,,
provision for income taxes respectively.,,,,,,
,We  file  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  in  many  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Our  two,,,,,
major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax,,,,,,
returns  by  the  IRS  and  other  tax  authorities.  The  IRS  is  currently  examining  our  2016  through  2018  tax  returns.  We,,,,,,
have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent,,,,,,
establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.,,,,,,
,The  tax  years  2014  through  2020  remain  subject  to  examination  by  the  appropriate  governmental  agencies  for,,,,,
Irish  tax  purposes.  There  are  other  ongoing  audits  in  various  other  jurisdictions  that  are  not  material  to  our  financial,,,,,,
statements.,,,,,,
,We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  these  examinations  to  determine  the,,,,,
adequacy  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  progress  of  ongoing  discussions  with  tax,,,,,,
authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.,,,,,,
,We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.,,,,,
However  the  outcome  of  tax  audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are,,,,,,
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for,,,,,,
income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is,,,,,,
not certain it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal state and non U.S. tax,,,,,,
positions could decrease by approximately 2.0 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include,,,,,,
various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.,,,,,,
