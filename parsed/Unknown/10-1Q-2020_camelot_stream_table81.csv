Technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results.
Technologies  have  been  developed  and  will  likely  continue  to  be  developed  that  can  block  the  display  of  our  ads  or  block  our  ad  measurement  tools
particularly for advertising displayed on personal computers. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the
display of ads on personal computers. Revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to
time. As a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to
mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed.
Real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
The numbers for our key metrics which include our Facebook metrics DAUs MAUs and average revenue per user ARPU and Family metrics DAP
MAP and average revenue per person ARPP are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based
on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our
products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also
susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change
due  to  improvements  or  changes  in  our  methodology.  We  regularly  review  our  processes  for  calculating  these  metrics  and  from  time  to  time  we  discover
inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our
historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not
intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.
