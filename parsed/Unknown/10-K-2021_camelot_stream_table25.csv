to  be  brought  against  us 
for  defamation  negligence  breaches  of  contract  copyright  and"
trademark  infringement  unfair  competition  unlawful  activity  torts  fraud  or  other  legal  theories  based  on  the  nature
and content of information available on or via our services.
We  may  be  subject  to  claims  by  virtue  of  our  involvement  in  hosting  transmitting  marketing  branding  or
providing  access  to  content  created  by  third  parties.  Defense  of  such  actions  could  be  costly  and  involve  significant
time  and  attention  of  our  management  and  other  resources  may  result  in  monetary  liabilities  or  penalties  and  may
require us to change our business in an adverse manner.
Privacy  and  data  protection  regulations  are  complex  and  rapidly  evolving  areas.  Any  failure  or  alleged
failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  harm  our  business  reputation  financial  condition  and  operating
results.
Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals
concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings legislation or regulation have
resulted in and may continue to result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices which could
have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to  provide  services  harming  our  business  operations.  Complying  with  these
evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services negatively affecting
our  business  and  may  be  particularly  challenging  during  certain  times  such  as  a  natural  disaster  or  pandemic.
Amongst others we are and will be subject to the following laws and regulations:
"•
The  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  GDPR  which  applies  to  all  of  our  activities  conducted  from  an"
establishment  in  the  EU  or  related  to  products  and  services  that  we  offer  to  EU  users  or  customers  or  the
monitoring of their behavior in the EU. Ensuring compliance with the range of obligations created by the GDPR
is  an  ongoing  commitment  that  involves  substantial  costs.  Despite  our  efforts  governmental  authorities  or
"others  have  asserted  and  may  continue 
to  assert 
that  our  business  practices 
fail 
to  comply  with 
its"
requirements.  If  our  operations  are  found  to  violate  the  GDPR  requirements  we  may  incur  substantial  fines
have to change our business practices and face reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect
on  our  business.  Serious  breaches  of  the  GDPR  can  result  in  administrative  fines  of  up  to  4  of  annual
worldwide  revenues.  Fines  of  up  to  2  of  annual  worldwide  revenues  can  be  levied  for  other  specified
violations.
"•
Various  state  privacy  laws  such  as  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act  of  2018  CCPA  which  came  into"
effect  in  January  of  2020;  the  California  Privacy  Rights  Act  CPRA  which  will  go  into  effect  in  2023;  the
Virginia  Consumer  Data  Protection  Act  Virginia  CDPA  which  will  go  into  effect  in  2023;  and  the  Colorado
Privacy  Act  ColoPA  which  will  go  into  effect  in  2023;  all  of  which  give  new  data  privacy  rights  to  their
respective  residents  including  in  California  a  private  right  of  action  in  the  event  of  a  data  breach  resulting
"from  our 
failure 
to 
implement  and  maintain  reasonable  security  procedures  and  practices  and 
impose"
significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.
"•
S-327 in California which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices."
Further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances
we can transfer process and/or receive personal data. The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that
previously allowed U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply
with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland have been invalidated by the CJEU.
The  CJEU  upheld  Standard  Contractual  Clauses  SCCs  as  a  valid  transfer  mechanism  provided  they  meet  certain
requirements. On June 4 2021 the European Commission published new SCCs for this purpose and we may have to
adapt our existing contractual arrangements to meet these new requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms
"remains  subject 
to 
legal  regulatory  and  political  developments 
in  both  Europe  and 
the  U.S.  such  as  recent"
recommendations from the European Data Protection oard decisions from supervisory authorities recent proposals
for  reform  of  the  data  transfer  mechanisms  for  transfers  of  personal  data  outside  the  United  Kingdom  and  potential
invalidation  of  other  data  transfer  mechanisms  which  together  with  increased  enforcement  action  from  supervisory
authorities in relation to cross-border transfers of personal data could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to
process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and/or the United Kingdom.
These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation including developments which create some
uncertainty  and  compliance  obligations  could  cause  us  to  incur  costs  or  harm  the  operations  of  our  products  and
services  in  ways  that  harm  our  business.  For  example  in  the  EU  several  supervisory  authorities  have  issued  new
guidance  concerning  the  ePrivacy  Directive’s  requirements  regarding  the  use  of  cookies  and  similar  technologies
including  limitations  on  the  use  of  data  across  messaging  products  and  specific  requirements  for  enabling  users  to
accept or reject cookies and have in some cases brought and may seek to bring in the future enforcement action in
relation to those requirements. In the U.S. certain types of cookies may be deemed sales of personal information
