,We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating,,,,,
our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax,,,,,,
benefits  was  7.1  billion  9.4  billion  and  12.6  billion  as  of  December  31  2022  2023  and  2024  respectively  of,,,,,,
which 5.3 billion 7.4 billion and 10.0 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate respectively.,,,,,,
,As of December 31 2023 and 2024 we accrued 622 million and 1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision,,,,,
for income taxes respectively.,,,,,,
,We  file  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  in  many  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Our  two,,,,,
major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax,,,,,,
returns  by  the  IRS  and  other  tax  authorities. The  IRS  is  currently  examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We,,,,,,
"have  also 
received 
tax  assessments 
in  multiple 
foreign",jurisdictions  asserting,,transfer  pricing  adjustments  or,,,
permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.,,,,,,
,The  tax  years  2016  through  2023  remain  subject  to  examination  by  the  appropriate  governmental  agencies  for,,,,,
Irish  tax  purposes. There  are  other  ongoing  audits  in  various  other  jurisdictions  that  are  not  material  to  our  financial,,,,,,
statements.,,,,,,
,We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  these  examinations  to  determine  the,,,,,
adequacy  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  progress  of  ongoing  discussions  with  tax,,,,,,
authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.,,,,,,
,We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.,,,,,
However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are,,,,,,
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for,,,,,,
income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is,,,,,,
not  certain  we  do  not  believe  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  from  certain  U.S.  federal,,,,,,
state and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.,,,,,,
