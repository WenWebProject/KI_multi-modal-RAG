unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions.
On July 27 2015 the United States Tax Court issued a decision Tax Court Decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which concluded that related parties
in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. On June 7 2019 the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion that reversed the Tax
Court Decision. ased on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of 1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July
22 2019 the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12 2019. The taxpayer has requested a hearing
before the Supreme Court of the United States. As a result the final outcome of the case is uncertain. In November 2019 we made a 1.64 billion payment related
to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the related tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the Altera Ninth
Circuit Opinion is reversed we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time.
"W
e  are  subject  to  taxation  in  the  United  States  and  various  other  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  The  material  jurisdictions  in  which  we  are  subject  to"
potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for our 2014 through 2016 tax years
and by the Ireland tax authorities for our 2012 through 2015 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2016 and
subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.
In July 2016 we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency Notice from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with
the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent
to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15 2020 the IRS filed its
Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of
the trial began in February 2020 and a second session is expected to continue later in the year. It is not clear how the IRS intends to apply the revised adjustment to
future years. ased on the information provided we believe that if the IRS prevails in its updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of
an estimated  aggregate  amount of up to approximately  9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally  filed  U.S. return plus interest  and any penalties
asserted.
In March 2018 we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its
position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain
tax  credits  that  we  claimed.  If  the  IRS  prevails  in  its  position  for  these  new  adjustments  this  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability  of  up  to
approximately 680 million in  excess  of  the  amounts  in  our  originally  filed  U.S.  returns  plus  interest  and  any  penalties  asserted.  We  do  not  agree  with  the
positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.
We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 Income Taxes that is lower than the potential
additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition if the IRS prevails in its positions
related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under
the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act. As of March 31 2020 we have not resolved these
matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.
We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items
that  may  ultimately  result  from  these  examinations.  The  timing  of the  resolution  settlement  and  closure  of any  audits  is highly  uncertain  and it  is reasonably
possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject
to examination we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail
in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of
operations and cash flows.
