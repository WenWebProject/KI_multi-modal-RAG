securities  may  not  directly  correlate  with  changes  in  valuation  of  marketable  equity  securities. As  of  December  31,
2023  and  2024  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  which  were  accounted  for  under  the,
measurement alternative was 28.8 billion and 35.5 billion respectively.,
,The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 1.7 billion and 2.0 billion as
of  December  31  2023  and  2024  respectively  generally  do  not  fluctuate  based  on  market  price  changes.  However,
these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.,
