measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in Europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the GDPR. We also
obtain  consent  and/or  offer  new  controls  to  existing  and  new  users  in  Europe  before  processing  data  for  certain  aspects  of  our  service.  In  addition  the  GDPR
requires  submission  of  personal  data  breach  notifications  to  our  designated  European  privacy  regulator  the  Irish  Data  Protection  Commission  and  includes
significant  penalties  for  non-compliance  with  the  notification  obligation  as  well  as  other  requirements  of  the  regulation.  Similarly  the  razilian  General  Data
Protection  Law  imposes  data  privacy-related  requirements  on  products  and  services  offered  to  users  in  razil  and  is  scheduled  to  go  in  effect  in  August  2020
although  the  deadline  to  comply  may  be  extended  to  a  later  date.  The  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act  CCPA  which  took  effect  in  January  2020  also
establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties.
These  laws  and  regulations  are  evolving  and  subject  to  interpretation  and  resulting  limitations  on  our  advertising  services  or  reductions  of  advertising  by
marketers  have  to  some  extent  adversely  affected  and  will  continue  to  adversely  affect  our  advertising  business.  Similarly  there  are  a  number  of  legislative
proposals  in  the  European  Union  the  United  States  at  both  the  federal  and  state  level  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  that  could  impose  new  obligations  or
limitations  in areas affecting  our business. In addition  some countries  are considering  or have passed legislation  implementing  data protection  requirements  or
requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
These laws and regulations as well as any associated claims inquiries or investigations or any other government actions have in the past led to and may in
the future lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs delays or impediments in the development of new products negative publicity and
reputational  harm  increased  operating  costs  diversion  of  management  time  and  attention  and  remedies  that  harm  our  business  including  fines  or  demands  or
orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such
proceedings  and  other  inquiries  in  the  future  which  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs  or  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner
materially adverse to our business.
From  time  to  time  we  receive  formal  and  informal  inquiries  from  government  authorities  and  regulators  regarding  our  compliance  with  laws  and
regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests
requests  for  information  actions  and  audits  in  the  United  States  Europe  and  around  the  world  particularly  in  the  areas  of  privacy  data  protection  law
enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition we are currently and may in the future be
subject  to  regulatory  orders  or  consent  decrees.  For  example  data  protection  competition  and  consumer  protection  authorities  in  the  European  Union  have
initiated  actions  investigations  or  administrative  orders  seeking  to  restrict  the  ways  in  which  we  collect  and  use  information  or  impose  sanctions  and  other
authorities  may  do  the  same.  In  addition  beginning  in  March  2018  we  became  subject  to  FTC  state  attorneys  general  and  other  government  inquiries  in  the
United States Europe and other  jurisdictions  in connection  with our platform  and user data  practices  as well as the misuse of certain  data by a developer  that
shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC
inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters our settlement with the FTC requires us to pay a penalty of
5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. eginning in September 2018 we also became subject
to  Irish  Data  Protection  Commission  IDPC  and  other  government  inquiries  in  connection  with  a  third-party  cyber-attack  that  exploited  a  vulnerability  in
Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also notify the IDPC our
designated European privacy regulator under the GDPR of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations
regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance.
In addition competition authorities in the United States Europe and other jurisdictions have initiated formal and informal inquiries and investigations into
many aspects of our business including with respect to users and advertisers as well as our industry. For example in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that
it  had  opened  an  antitrust  investigation  of  our  company.  In  addition  beginning  in  the  third  quarter  of  2019  we  became  the  subject  of  antitrust  inquiries  and
investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice the U.S. House of Representatives and state attorneys general. These inquiries and investigations concern among
other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising and/or mobile or online applications as well as
past acquisitions.
Orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us
to  unanticipated  civil  and  criminal  liability  or  penalties  including  substantial  monetary  remedies  interrupt  or  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a
