Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information
International revenues which represent a significant portion of our revenues are generally transacted in multiple
currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The  effect  of  currency  exchange  rates  on  our  business  is  an  important  factor  in  understanding  period-to-period
"comparisons.  We  use  non-GAAP  constant  currency 
revenues 
""constant  currency 
revenues""  and  non-GAAP"
"percentage change in constant currency revenues ""percentage change in constant currency revenues"" for financial"
"and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means 
to  evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe

presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles
GAAP  results  helps  improve  the  ability  to  understand  our  performance  because  it  excludes  the  effects  of  foreign
currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
Constant  currency  information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant
period  over  period.  We  define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency
"exchange rate movements ""FX Effect"" as well as hedging activities which are recognized at the consolidated level."
We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year
basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable
period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
"Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change 
is  calculated  by  determining 
the  change 
in  current  period"
revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated
using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.
These  results  should  be  considered  in  addition  to  not  as  a  substitute  for  results  reported  in  accordance  with
GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
