Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual
product. Accordingly for our Family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not
reflect  the  actual  size  of  our  community.  Rather  our  Family  metrics  represent  our  estimates  of  the  number  of  unique  people  using  at  least  one  of  Facebook
Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier  or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family and
therefore  must  seek  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across  products  to  individual  people.  To  calculate  these  metrics  we  rely  upon  complex
techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts
within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one
person. These techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical
variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well. While
we  expect  the  error  margin  for  our  Family  metrics  to  vary  from  period  to  period  we  estimate  that  such  margin  generally  will  be  approximately  3  of  our
worldwide MAP. At our scale  it  is very  difficult  to attribute  multiple  user accounts  within and across products  to individual  people  and it is possible that  the
actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result it is
also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.
To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of
limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates.
For example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information IP addresses
and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently
subject to error. In addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics
estimates.  Our  techniques  and  models  rely  on  a  variety  of  data  signals  from  different  products  and  we  rely  on  more  limited  data  signals  for  some  products
compared to others. For example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily
rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly although Messenger Kids users
are included in our Family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and MAP. Any
loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by third-party browser
or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors also
may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including
through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may
improve our ability  to match  accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate  the broad population of our users. In addition such evolution may
allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below.
"We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of ""violating"" accounts. We define ""violating"" accounts"
as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2019 we
estimated that approximately 3 of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample
of  accounts  and  we  apply  significant  judgment  in  making  this  determination.  For  example  we  look  for  account  information  and  behaviors  associated  with
Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In
addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we
believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other
actions  to  reduce  the number  of  violating  accounts  among  our users  which  may  also  reduce  our  DAP and  MAP estimates  in  a  particular  period.  We  intend  to
disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at
our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.
Other  data  limitations  also  may  affect  our  understanding  of  certain  details  of  our  business.  For  example  while  user-provided  data  indicates  a  decline  in
usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly our
understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.
