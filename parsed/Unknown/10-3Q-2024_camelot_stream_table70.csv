The  DOJ  various  U.S.  states  and  other  plaintiffs  have  filed  and  may  continue  to  file  in  the  future  several
antitrust  lawsuits  about  various  aspects  of  our  business  including  our  advertising  technologies  and  practices  the
operation and distribution of Google Search and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and
Play Store.
For  example  the  DOJ  and  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General  filed  a  lawsuit  alleging  that  Google  violated
antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising and in August 2024 the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine
remedies  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  services  and  our  business  models  and  operations
including structural remedies and/or our distribution arrangements among other changes. While we plan to appeal
there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity
of  any  remedies  that  may  be  ordered  and  any  or  all  of  these  potential  remedies  could  harm  our  business
reputation financial condition and operating results.
Also  in  December  2023  a  California  jury  delivered  a  verdict  in  Epic  Games  v.  Google  finding  that  Google
violated  antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play's  business.  The  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  on
October  7  2024  that  ordered  a  variety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  contractual
agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of
some of the remedies pending the appeal but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or
in  our  efforts  to  pause  the  implementation  of  the  remedies  pending  the  appeal.  If  we  are  unsuccessful  we  could
face  significant  expenses  to  implement  the  remedies  and  such  costs  and  alterations  could  harm  our  business
reputation financial condition and operating results.
