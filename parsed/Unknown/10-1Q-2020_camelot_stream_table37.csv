During the first quarter of 2020 worldwide ARPU was 6.95 an increase of 8 from the first quarter of 2019. Over this period ARPU increased by 13 in
United States & Canada 11 in Europe 10 in Asia-Pacific and 5 in Rest of World. In addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively
lower ARPU such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is
relatively lower such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if
ARPU increases in each geographic region.
