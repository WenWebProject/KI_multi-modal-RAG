The  incurrence  of  indebtedness  would  also  result  in  increased  fixed  obligations  and  increased  interest  expense  and  could  also  include  covenants  or  other
restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to
retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders. In
addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the
price of our Class A common stock.
We may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in
significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the
accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount
of  time  in  which  acquisitions  are  executed.  In  addition  we  may  fail  to  accurately  forecast  the  financial  impact  of  an  acquisition  transaction  including  tax  and
accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-
lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.
The  integration  of  acquisitions  requires  significant  time  and  resources  and  we may not  manage  these  processes  successfully.  Our ability  to  successfully
integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have
prior experience. For example the technology and products we acquired from Oculus were relatively new to Facebook at the time of the acquisition and we did
not  have  significant  experience  with  or  structure  in  place  to  support  such  technology  and  products  prior  to  the  acquisition.  We  continue  to  make  substantial
investments  of  resources  to  support  our  acquisitions  which  will  result  in  significant  ongoing  operating  expenses  and  may  divert  resources  and  management
attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we
acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.
If our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable
such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are
deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be
required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is
determined which would negatively affect our results of operations.
Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results.
Our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical
infrastructure. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to
time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that
could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not
use  our  products  as  often  in  the  future  or  at  all  and  our  ability  to  serve  ads  may  be  disrupted  any  of which  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  financial
performance. As the amount and types of information shared on Facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global
community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including
network capacity  and computing  power to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue  to effectively  scale  and grow our technical
infrastructure  to  accommodate  these  increased  demands  which  may  adversely  affect  our  user  engagement  and  advertising  revenue  growth.  In  addition  our
business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism
geopolitical  conflict other physical security threats cyber-attacks  or other catastrophic  events. If such an event were to occur users may be subject to service
disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart
