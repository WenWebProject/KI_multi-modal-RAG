•,illnesses to key employees or a significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiencies delays and disruptions in our business; and
•,increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.
,Any of these developments may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory actions against us. The persistence of
COVID-19 and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness will impact our ability to operate our business and may materially,
and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations.,
If we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and,
business may be significantly harmed.,
,The  size  of  our  user  base  and  our  users'  level  of  engagement  are  critical  to  our  success.  Our  financial  performance  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be
significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that,

region. More recently we have experienced a significant increase in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the,

future. If people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase,
the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user,
bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or,
engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and,
different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if:,
