or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results.
For example the significant and rapid increase in the use of our products that we experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased demands
on our technical infrastructure. Additional product development efforts during this time may put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure. We may not be
able to accommodate these demands including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.
A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers
could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may
adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. The
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure.
As a result we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs or we may be required to procure such services
or equipment on unfavorable terms.
Any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products require unfavorable changes to existing products
delay the introduction of future products or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
We could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.
We  have  designed  and  built  our  own  data  centers  and  key  portions  of  our  technical  infrastructure  through  which  we  serve  our  products  and  we plan  to
continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is
complex  and  involves  projects  in  multiple  locations  and  we  have  had  to  suspend  certain  of  these  projects  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Additional
unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or
availability  of  components  challenges  in  obtaining  required  government  or  regulatory  approvals  or  other  geopolitical  challenges  or  actions  by  governments
whether as a result of the pandemic or otherwise may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of
the quality or reliability of our products. In addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and
implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or
increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results.
Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any errors bugs or vulnerabilities in these systems or failures
to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems could adversely affect our business.
Our  products  and  internal  systems  rely  on  software  and  hardware  including  software  and  hardware  developed  or  maintained  internally  and/or  by  third
parties that is highly technical and complex. In addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve
process  and  manage  immense  amounts  of  data.  The  software  and  hardware  on  which  we  rely  has  contained  and  will  in  the  future  contain  errors  bugs  or
vulnerabilities  and  our  systems  are  subject  to  certain  technical  limitations  that  may  compromise  our  ability  to  meet  our  objectives.  Some  errors  bugs  or
vulnerabilities  inherently  may  be  difficult  to  detect  and  may  only  be  discovered  after  the  code  has  been  released  for  external  or  internal  use.  For  example  in
September 2018 we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access
certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors bugs vulnerabilities design defects or technical limitations within the software and hardware
on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products
compromised  ability  of  our  products  to  perform  in  a  manner  consistent  with  our  terms  contracts  or  policies  delayed  product  introductions  or  enhancements
targeting  measurement  or  billing  errors  compromised  ability  to  protect  the  data  of  our  users  and/or  our  intellectual  property  or  reductions  in  our  ability  to
provide some or all of our services. For example we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products and our
systems  are  subject  to  errors  bugs  and  technical  limitations  that  may  prevent  us  from  fulfilling  these  commitments  reliably.  In  addition  any  errors  bugs
vulnerabilities or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our
systems or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users have in the past led to and may in the future lead
to outcomes including damage to our reputation loss of users loss of marketers loss of revenue regulatory inquiries litigation or liability for fines damages or
other remedies any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
