Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google  Search  &  other  revenues  increased  23.1  billion  from  2023  to  2024. The  overall  growth  was  driven  by
interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile
devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased 4.6 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was driven by our brand advertising
products followed by our direct response advertising products both of which benefited from increased spending by our
advertisers.
Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased 953 million from 2023 to 2024 primarily driven by a decrease in Google
Ad  Manager  and  AdMob  revenues.  Additionally  Google  Network  revenues  were  adversely  affected  by  changes  in
foreign currency exchange rates.
