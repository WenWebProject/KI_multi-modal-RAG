Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our  management  with  the  participation  of  our  chief  executive  officer  CEO  and  chief  financial  officer  CFO  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a- 15e and 15d- 15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended Exchange Act as of
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. ased on such evaluation our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of March 31 2020 our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required
to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and  forms  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  SEC  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management  including  our
CEO and CFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15d or 15d-15d of the
Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting management recognizes that any controls
and  procedures  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  the  desired  control  objectives.  In  addition  the
design  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that
management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
