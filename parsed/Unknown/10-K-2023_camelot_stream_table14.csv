RISK FACTORS",,,,
,Our  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties  including  but  not  limited  to,,,
those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results and affect,,,,
the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.,,,,
,Risks Specific to our Company,,,
,We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers a,,,
loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize,,,,
ads could harm our business.,,,,
,We  generated  more  than  75  of  total  revenues  from  online  advertising  in  2023.  Many  of  our  advertisers,,,
companies  that  distribute  our  products  and  services  digital  publishers  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their,,,,
contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value,,,,
such  as  increased  numbers  of  users  or  customers  new  sales  leads  increased  brand  awareness  or  more  effective,,,,
monetization than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices such as,,,,
our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies as well as changes to other companiesâ€™ advertising and/or data privacy,,,,
practices  have  in  the  past  and  may  in  the  future  affect  the  advertising  that  we  are  able  to  provide.  In  addition,,,,
technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether,,,,
and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability,,,,
and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively,,,,
and competitively could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,In  addition  expenditures  by  advertisers,"tend 
to",correlate  with  overall  economic,conditions.  Adverse
macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected  and  may  in  the  future  affect  the  demand  for  advertising  resulting  in,,,,
fluctuations  in  the  amounts  our  advertisers  spend  on  advertising  which  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and,,,,
operating results.,,,,
,We  face  intense  competition.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that,,,
are  useful  to  users  customers  and  other  partners  we  may  not  remain  competitive  which  could  harm  our,,,,
business financial condition and operating results.,,,,
Our  business  environment,is,rapidly  evolving  and,intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses,face  changing
technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,,,,
we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services,,,,
and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a,,,,
wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and,,,,
R&D including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology products and services.,,,,
We  have  many  competitors,,in  different,industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and,international
competitors  range  from  large  and  established  companies  to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have  longer,,,,
operating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources,,,,
in  ways  that  could  affect  our  competitive  position  including  by  making  acquisitions  and  entering  into  other  strategic,,,,
arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure R&D and in talent; initiating intellectual property,,,,
and competition claims whether or not meritorious; and continuing to compete for users advertisers customers and,,,,
content providers. Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to,,,,
aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our,,,,
competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the,,,,
need for products and services before we do.,,,,
,We are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to,,,
integrate  AI  capabilities  into  our  products  and  services.  AI  technology  and  services  are  highly  competitive  rapidly,,,,
evolving and require significant investment including development and operational costs to meet the changing needs,,,,
and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for,,,,
our  products  and  services  and  for  our  business  strategy  may  depend  on  the  availability  and  pricing  of  third-party,,,,
equipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally other companies may develop AI products and technologies that,,,,
are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have or in the,,,,
future may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use,,,,
or sell our own AI products and services.,,,,
,Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the,,,
evolving  needs  and  desires  of  our  users  advertisers  publishers  customers  and  content  providers.  As  new  and,,,,
existing technologies continue to develop competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are or,,,,
