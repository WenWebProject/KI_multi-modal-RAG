5.7        Limitations on  Exercise.  The  Committee  may  specify  a  minimum  number  of  Shares  that  may  be  purchased  on  any
exercise of an Option provided that such minimum number will not prevent any Participant from exercising the Option for the full number of
Shares for which it is then exercisable.
5.8    Limitations on ISOs. With respect to Awards granted as ISOs to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the
Shares with respect to which such ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the

For  purposes  of  this  Section  5.8  ISOs  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the  order  in  which  they  were  granted.  The  Fair  Market  Value  of  the
Shares  will  be  determined  as  of  the  time  the  Option  with  respect  to  such  Shares  is  granted.  In  the  event  that  the  Code  or  the  regulations
promulgated thereunder are amended after the Effective Date to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to
be subject to ISOs such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date
of such amendment.
5.9    Modification Extension or Renewal. The Committee may modify extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize
the grant of new Options in substitution therefor provided that any such action may not without the written consent of a Participant impair

altered  will  be  treated  in  accordance  with  Section  424h  of  the  Code.  Subject  to  Section  18  of  this  Plan  by  written  notice  to  affected
Participants  the  Committee  may  reduce  the  Exercise  Price  of  outstanding  Options  without  the  consent  of  such  Participants;  provided
however that the Exercise Price may not be reduced below the Fair Market Value on the date the action is taken to reduce the Exercise Price.

interpreted amended or altered nor will any discretion or authority granted under this Plan be exercised so as to disqualify this Plan under
Section 422 of the Code or without the consent of the Participant affected to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code.
