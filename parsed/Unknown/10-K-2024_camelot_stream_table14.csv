monetization than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices such as,
our  initiatives  related  to  third-party  cookies  including  our  announcement  in  July  2024  to  move  from  phasing  out  all,
third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model which remains subject to continuing discussions with regulators,
as  well  as  changes  to  other  companies’  advertising  and/or  data  privacy  practices  have  in  the  past  and  may  in  the,
future affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition technologies have been developed that,
make personalized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services,
"have 
integrated 
technologies 
that  could  potentially 
impair","the  availability  and 
functionality  of 
third-party  digital"
advertising.  Failing  to  provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our,
business reputation financial condition and operating results.,
"In  addition  expenditures  by  advertisers 
tend 
to","correlate  with  overall  economic 
conditions.  Adverse"
macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected  and  may  in  the  future  affect  the  demand  for  advertising  resulting  in,
fluctuations  in  the  amounts  our  advertisers  spend  on  advertising  which  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and,
operating results.,
,We  face  intense  competition.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that
are  useful  to  users  customers  and  other  partners  we  may  not  remain  competitive  which  could  harm  our,
business financial condition and operating results.,
"Our  business  environment 
is 
rapidly  evolving  and","intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses 
face  changing"
technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,
we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services,
and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a,
wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and,
R&D including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology products and services.,
"We  have  many  competitors 
in  different","industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and 
international"
competitors  range  from  large  and  established  companies  to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have  longer,
operating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources,
in  ways  that  could  affect  our  competitive  position  including  by  making  acquisitions  and  entering  into  other  strategic,
arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure R&D and in talent; initiating intellectual property,
and competition claims whether or not meritorious; and continuing to compete for users advertisers customers and,
content providers. Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to,
aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our,
competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we,
can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do.,
,We are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to
integrate  AI  capabilities  into  our  products  and  services.  AI  technology  and  services  are  highly  competitive  rapidly,
evolving and require significant investment including technical infrastructure development and operational costs to,
meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI,
technologies  critical  for  our  products  and  services  and  for  our  business  strategy  may  depend  on  the  availability  and,
pricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs including network capacity energy,
and  equipment  costs.  Additionally  other  companies  may  develop  AI  products  and  technologies  that  are  similar  or,
superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have or in the,
future may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use,
or sell our own AI products and services.,
,Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a
timely  manner  to  the  evolving  needs  and  desires  of  our  users  advertisers  publishers  customers  and  content,
providers  or  if  we  miscalculate  those  needs  and  desires  and  invest  significantly  in  areas  that  fail  to  gain  sufficient,
market traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop competitors and new entrants may be able to,
offer experiences that are or that are perceived to be substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies,
could  reduce  usage  of  our  products  and  services  and  force  us  to  compete  in  different  ways  and  expend  significant,
resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling,
products  and  services  or  in  attracting  and  retaining  users  advertisers  publishers  customers  and  content  providers,
could harm our financial condition and operating results.,
,Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and
could divert management attention and harm our business financial condition and operating results.,
,We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies in a
wide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses such,
