Alphabet Inc."
The shift to online as well as the advent of the multi-device world has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.
including  in  emerging  markets  such  as  India.  We  continue  to  invest  heavily  and  develop  localized  versions  of  our
products  and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased
revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these
markets  particularly  as  low-cost  mobile  devices  become  more  available.  This  trend  could  affect  our  revenues  as
developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
International  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  While  we  have  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program
designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues
and earnings.

The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins."
Revenues from cloud consumer subscriptions platforms and devices which may have differing characteristics
than our advertising revenues have grown over time and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding
our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins
on  our  advertising  revenues.  For  example  sales  of  our  devices    adversely  affect  our  consolidated  margins  due  to
pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.
"•
As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and"
capital expenditures.
We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to
develop  new  innovative  offerings  improve  our  existing  offerings  and  rapidly  and  responsibly  deploy AI  across  our
businesses.  We  also  expect  to  increase  relative  to  2023  our  investment  in  our  technical  infrastructure  including
servers network equipment and data centers to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives in
particular in support of AI products and services. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the
breadth and depth of our offerings expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and build strong
partnerships around strategic initiatives.
"•
We  continue  to  face  an  evolving  regulatory  environment  and  we  are  subject  to  claims  lawsuits"
investigations  and  other  forms  of  potential  legal  liability  which  could  affect  our  business  practices  and
financial results.
Changes  in  social  political  economic  tax  and  regulatory  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  a  wide
range  of  topics  and  related  legal  matters  including  investigations  lawsuits  and  regulatory  actions  have  resulted  in
fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue our cost of doing business may
increase  our  ability  to  pursue  certain  business  models  or  offer  certain  products  or  services  may  be  limited  and  we
may need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the
antitrust  complaints  filed  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  and  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General;  legislative
proposals  and  pending  litigation  in  the  U.S.  EU  and  around  the  world  that  could  diminish  or  eliminate  safe  harbor
protection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various
legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk
Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them."
Our  employees  are  among  our  best  assets  and  are  critical  for  our  continued  success.  We  expect  to  continue
"hiring 
talented  employees  around 
the  globe  and 
to  provide  competitive  compensation  programs.  For  additional"
information see Culture and Workforce in Part I Item 1 usiness of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenues and Monetization Metrics
We generate revenues by delivering relevant cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide
enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration
tools; sales of other products and services such as apps and in-app purchases and devices; and fees received for
consumer  subscription-based  products.  For  additional  information  on  how  we  recognize  revenue  see  Note  1  of  the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above fluctuations in our
revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of general factors including:
