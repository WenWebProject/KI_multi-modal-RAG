The,"total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized 
tax  benefits  was  4.7  billion  3.4  billion  and  3.8  billion  as  of"
December  31  2018  2019  and  2020  respectively  of  which  2.9  billion  2.3  billion  and  2.6  billion  if  recognized,
would affect our effective tax rate respectively. The decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2019 was primarily,
as a result of the resolution of multi-year audits.,
,As  of  December  31  2019  and  2020  we  accrued  130  million  and  222  million  in  interest  and  penalties  in
provision for income taxes respectively.,
,We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions our two major
tax  jurisdictions  are  the  U.S.  federal  and  Ireland.  We  are  subject  to  the  continuous  examination  of  our  income  tax,
returns  by  the  IRS  and  other  tax  authorities.  The  IRS  is  currently  examining  our  2016  through  2018  tax  returns.  We,
have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent,
establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.,
,The  tax  years  2011  through  2019  remain  subject  to  examination  by  the  appropriate  governmental  agencies  for
Irish  tax  purposes.  There  are  other  ongoing  audits  in  various  other  jurisdictions  that  are  not  material  to  our  financial,
statements.,
,We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  these  examinations  to  determine  the
adequacy  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  progress  of  ongoing  discussions  with  tax,
authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.,
,We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However  the  outcome  of  tax  audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are,
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for,
income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is,
not certain we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the,
next 12 months.,
