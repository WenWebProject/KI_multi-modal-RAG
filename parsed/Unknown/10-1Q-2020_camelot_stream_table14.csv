Losses  on  Financial  Instruments  using  the  modified  retrospective  transition  method.  Upon  adoption  we  changed  our  impairment  model  to  utilize  a  forward-,,,
looking current expected credit losses CECL model in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost including our,,,
"accounts receivable. In addition we modified our impairment model to the CECL model for AFS debt securities and discontinued using the concept of ""other than",,,
"temporary""  impairment  on  AFS  debt  securities.  CECL  estimates  on  accounts  receivable  are recorded  as  general  and  administrative  expenses  on our  condensed",,,
consolidated  statements  of  income.  CECL  estimates  on  AFS  debt  securities  are  recognized  in  interest  and  other  income  expense  net  on  our  condensed,,,
consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our condensed consolidated financial statements.,,,
Significant Accounting Policies,,,
,There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,,
2019 except for the policies noted below which changed as a result of the adoption of Topic 326.,,,
,Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Restricted Cash,,
,Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.,,
,We hold investments in marketable securities consisting of U.S. government securities U.S. government agency securities and investment grade corporate,,
debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as AFS investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current,,,
operations.,Our  AFS  investments  are  carried  at  estimated  fair  value  with  any  unrealized  gains  and  losses,net  of  taxes,included  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine,,,
what  amount  of  that  difference  if  any  is  caused  by  expected  credit  losses.  Expected  credit  losses  on  AFS  debt  securities  are  recognized  in  interest  and  other,,,
income expense net on our condensed consolidated statements of income and any remaining unrealized losses net of taxes are included in accumulated other,,,
comprehensive  loss  in  stockholders'  equity.  The  amount  of  credit  losses  recorded  for  the  three months  ended  March  31  2020 was  not  material.  We  have  not,,,
recorded any impairment charge for unrealized losses in the periods presented. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific,,,
identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income expense net.,,,
Accounts Receivable and Allowances,,,
,Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates,,
of expected credit losses for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors including,,,
historical  experience  the  age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances  credit  quality  of  our  customers  current  economic  conditions  reasonable  and  supportable,,,
forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The estimated credit loss allowance is recorded as,,,
general and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of income. As of March 31 2020 we reported 7.29 billion of accounts receivable,,,
net of an allowance of 370 million.,,,
