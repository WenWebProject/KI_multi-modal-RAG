Inventory,,,,,
,Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is,,,,
computed using the first-in first-out method.,,,,,
Variable Interest Entities,,,,,
,We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in,,,,
which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE. We consolidate VIEs when we are,,,,,
the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most,,,,,
significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses,,,,,
or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a,,,,,
VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.,,,,,
,Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination,,,,
of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary.,,,,,
Property and Equipment,,,,,
,Property  and  equipment  includes  the  following  categories:  land  and  buildings  information  technology  assets,,,,
construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land offices,,,,,
data  centers  and,related  building,improvements.,Information,technology  assets,include  servers  and  network
equipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet,,,,,
been placed in service.,,,,,
,We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using,,,,
the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets  which  we  regularly  evaluate.  Land  is  not,,,,,
depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets,,,,,
generally over periods of four to five years generally four years for servers and five years for network equipment. We,,,,,
depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the,,,,,
assets. Depreciation for buildings information technology assets leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures,,,,,
commences once they are ready for our intended use.,,,,,
Leases,,,,,
,We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-,,,,
lease  components.  Payments  under  our  lease  arrangements  are  primarily  fixed.  Non-lease  components  primarily,,,,,
include  payments  for  maintenance  and  utilities.  We  combine  fixed  payments  for  non-lease  components  with  lease,,,,,
payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets,,,,,
and liabilities.,,,,,
,Certain  lease  agreements  contain  variable  payments  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  not  included  in  the,,,,
lease  assets  and  liabilities.  These  amounts  include  payments  affected  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  payments,,,,,
contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements and payments for maintenance and utilities.,,,,,
,Lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  at  the  lease,,,,
commencement  date.  The  interest  rate  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  is  our,,,,,
incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental,,,,,
borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,,,,,
and  in  economic  environments  where  the  leased  asset  is  located.  Our  lease  terms  include  periods  under  options  to,,,,,
extend  or  terminate  the  lease  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option.  We  generally  use  the,,,,,
base  non-cancelable  lease  term  when  determining  the  lease  assets  and  liabilities.  Lease  assets  also  include  any,,,,,
prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.,,,,,
,Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated alance Sheets. The current portion of our,,,,
operating  lease  liabilities  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  and  the  long-term  portion  is,,,,,
included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net. Finance lease,,,,,
liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.,,,,,
,Operating  lease  expense  excluding  variable  lease  costs  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease,,,,
term.,,,,,
Long-Lived Assets Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets,,,,,
,We  review  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  excluding  goodwill  for  impairment  when  events  or,,,,
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable. The  evaluation  is  performed  at  the,,,,,
lowest  level  of  identifiable  cash  flows  independent  of  other  assets.  We  measure  recoverability  of  these  assets  by,,,,,
