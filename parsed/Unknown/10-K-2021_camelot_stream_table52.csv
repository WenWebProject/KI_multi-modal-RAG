European Commission Fines,,,,
,In  2017  2018  and  2019  the  EC  announced  decisions  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  infringed  European,,,
competition  law  and  imposed  fines  of  €2.4  billion  2.7  billion  as  of  June  27  2017  €4.3  billion  5.1  billion  as  of,,,,
June  30  2018  and  €1.5  billion  1.7  billion  as  of  March  20  2019  respectively.  While  each  EC  decision  is  under,,,,
appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated alance Sheets as,,,,
we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fines.,,,,
Taxes,,,,
,As of December 31 2021 we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of 784 million and 5.7 billion,,,
"related  to  a  one-time  transition  tax  payable  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  ""Tax  Act"".  As",,,,
permitted by the Tax Act we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have,,,,
taxes payable of 3.5 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31 2021.,,,,

operations and build-outs information technology assets office buildings purchases of inventory and network capacity,,,,
arrangements.  As  of  December  31  2021  such  purchase  commitments  which  do  not  qualify  for  recognition  on  our,,,,

Critical Accounting Estimates,,,,
,We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  doing  so  we  have  to  make,,,
estimates  and  assumptions.  Our  critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  involve  a  significant  level  of,,,,
uncertainty  at  the  time  the  estimate  was  made  and  changes  in  them  have  had  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a,,,,
material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly actual results could differ materially from,,,,
our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under,,,,
the  circumstances  and  we  evaluate  these  estimates  on  an  ongoing  basis.  We  have  reviewed  our  critical  accounting,,,,
estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our oard of Directors.,,,,
,See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form,,,
10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.,,,,
Fair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities,,,,
,We  measure  certain  financial  instruments  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  consisting  primarily  of  our  non-,,,
marketable  equity  securities.  These,,investments  are  accounted,for  under,the  measurement  alternative  and  are
measured  at  cost  less  impairment  subject  to  upward  and  downward  adjustments  resulting  from  observable  price,,,,
changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of,,,,
the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined,,,,
by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available which,,,,
may include cash flow projections or other available market data.,,,,
,Non-marketable  equity  securities  are  also  evaluated  for  impairment  based  on  qualitative  factors  including  the,,,
"companies' 
financial  and",liquidity  position  and  access,to  capital,resources  among  others.  When,indicators  of
impairment  exist  we  prepare  quantitative  measurements  of  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  investments  using  a  market,,,,
approach  or  an  income  approach  which  requires  judgment  and  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  including  discount,,,,
rates  investee  revenues  and  costs  and  comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies  among  others.,,,,
When our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we write down the investment to its fair value.,,,,
