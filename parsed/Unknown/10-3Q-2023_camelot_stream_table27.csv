Note 4.    Variable Interest Entities VIE,,,,,,,,,,
Consolidated VIEs,,,,,,,,,,
,We  consolidate  VIEs  in  which  we  hold  a  variable  interest  and  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  The  results  of,,,,,,,,,
operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.,,,,,,,,,,
,For certain consolidated VIEs their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to,,,,,,,,,
us. As of December 31 2022 and September 30 2023 assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these,,,,,,,,,,
VIEs were 4.1 billion and 2.6 billion respectively and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the,,,,,,,,,,
VIEs  were  2.6  billion  and  2.2  billion  respectively.  We  may  continue  to  fund  ongoing  operations  of  certain  VIEs,,,,,,,,,,
that are included within Other ets.,,,,,,,,,,
,Total  noncontrolling  interests  NCI  in  our  consolidated  subsidiaries  were  3.8  billion  and  3.4  billion  as  of,,,,,,,,,
December  31  2022  and  September  30  2023  respectively  of  which  1.1  billion  is  redeemable  noncontrolling,,,,,,,,,,
interest RNCI for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to,,,,,,,,,,
"noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the ""other"" component of",,,,,,,,,,
OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.,,,,,,,,,,
Unconsolidated VIEs,,,,,,,,,,
We  have,investments,in  VIEs,,in  which  we  are  not,,the  primary  beneficiary.  These  VIEs,,,,include  private
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve,,,,,,,,,,
power generation using renewable sources.,,,,,,,,,,
,We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that,,,,,,,,,
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and the results,,,,,,,,,,
of  operations  and  financial  position  of  these  VIEs  are  not  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  We,,,,,,,,,,
account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.,,,,,,,,,,
,The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the,,,,,,,,,
investments  and  any,future,,funding  commitments.  The  maximum  exposure  and  carrying  value  of,,,,,,,these
unconsolidated VIEs were 2.8 billion and 2.7 billion respectively as of December 31 2022 and 5.5 billion and,,,,,,,,,,
3.8  billion  respectively  as  of  September  30  2023.  The  difference  between  the  maximum  exposure  and  the,,,,,,,,,,
carrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments.,,,,,,,,,,
Note 5.    Debt,,,,,,,,,,
Short-Term Debt,,,,,,,,,,
,We  have  a  debt  financing  program  of  up  to  10.0  billion  through  the  issuance  of  commercial  paper.  Net,,,,,,,,,
proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as,,,,,,,,,,
of December 31 2022 and September 30 2023.,,,,,,,,,,
