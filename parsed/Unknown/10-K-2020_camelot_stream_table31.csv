Also  the  anticipated  benefits  or  value  of  our  acquisitions  and  other  strategic  transactions  may  not  materialize.  In,,,,
connection  with  our  divestitures  we  have  agreed  and  may  in  the  future  agree  to  provide  indemnification  for  certain,,,,
potential liabilities which may harm our financial condition or operating results.,,,,
,If we were to lose the services of key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy.,,,
,Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management,,,
team. For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an,,,,
important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of,,,,
our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance,,,,
policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.,,,,
,We rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified,,,
personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectively.,,,,
,Our  performance  largely  depends  on  the  talents  and  efforts  of  highly  skilled  individuals.  Our  ability  to  compete,,,
effectively  and  our  future  success  depends  on  our  continuing  to  identify  hire  develop  motivate  and  retain  highly,,,,
skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and,,,,
certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition our compensation arrangements such as,,,,
our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating,,,,
our  existing  employees.  Restrictive  immigration  policy  and  regulatory  changes  may  also  impact  our  ability  to  hire,,,,
mobilize or retain some of our global talent.,,,,
,In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork. As our organization,,,
grows  and  evolves  we  may  need  to  implement  more  complex  organizational  management  structures  or  adapt  our,,,,
corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or,,,,
pandemic including COVID-19 and these changes could impact our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse,,,,
impact on our corporate culture.,,,,
,We  are  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  the  market  values  of  our  investments  and  in  some  instances  our,,,
financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations,,,,
over time.,,,,

changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates the effect of new or changing regulations,,,,
the  stock  market,in  general  or  other,factors.  The  effect  of  COVID-19  on  our,impairment  assessment,for  non-
marketable  investments  requires  significant  judgment  due  to  the  uncertainty  around  the  duration  and  severity  of  the,,,,
impact.,,,,
,We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments certain other instruments including stock-,,,
based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other ets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a,,,,
business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate,,,,
valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs require management judgment and estimation and may change,,,,
over time.,,,,
,We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of,,,
identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity,,,,
securities realized and unrealized are recognized in other income expense which increases the volatility of our other,,,,
income expense. The unrealized gains and losses we record on our non-marketable equity securities in any particular,,,,
period may differ significantly from the realized gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments.,,,,
,As  a  result  of  these  factors  the  value  or  liquidity  of  our  cash  equivalents  as  well  as  our  marketable  and  non-,,,
marketable  securities  could  decline  and  result  in  a  material  impairment  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial,,,,
condition and operating results.,,,,
