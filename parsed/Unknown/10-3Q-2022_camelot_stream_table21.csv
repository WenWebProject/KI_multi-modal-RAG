fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other,,,,,,,
income expense net or revenues or in the Consolidated alance Sheets in AOCI as discussed below.,,,,,,,
We  enter,,into  master  netting  arrangements  which,reduce  credit,risk  by  permitting  net  settlement  of,,,
transactions  with  the  same  counterparty.  Further  we  enter  into  collateral  security  arrangements  that  provide  for,,,,,,,
collateral,to  be  received  or  pledged  when,the  net,fair  value  of  certain,financial,instruments,fluctuates,from
contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral,,,,,,,
security  arrangements  are  included  in  other  current  assets  with  a  corresponding  liability.  Cash  and  non-cash,,,,,,,
collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other,,,,,,,
current assets.,,,,,,,
Cash Flow Hedges,,,,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts including collars as cash flow hedges to hedge,,,,,,
certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have,,,,,,,
maturities of 24 months or less.,,,,,,,
,Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and,,,,,,
subsequently  reclassified  to  revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  the  change  in,,,,,,,
forward  points  and  time  value  from  our  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness.  The  initial  value  of  the  excluded,,,,,,,
component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.,,,,,,,
The  difference  between  fair  value  changes  of  the  excluded  component  and  the  amount  amortized  to  revenues  is,,,,,,,
recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring the corresponding amounts in AOCI,,,,,,,
are reclassified to other income expense net in the period of de-designation.,,,,,,,
,As  of  September  30  2022  the  net  accumulated  gain  on  our  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges  before  tax,,,,,,
effect was 1.9 billion which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.,,,,,,,
Fair Value Hedges,,,,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our,,,,,,
investments  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Fair  value  hedge  amounts  included  in  the,,,,,,,
assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income expense net along with the offsetting gains,,,,,,,
and  losses  of  the  related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  changes  in  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge,,,,,,,
effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income expense net.,,,,,,,
Net Investment Hedges,,,,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks,,,,,,
related  to  our  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  Net  investment  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of,,,,,,,
hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in AOCI  along  with  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment.  We  exclude,,,,,,,
changes  in  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and  recognize  changes  in  the  excluded,,,,,,,
component in other income expense net.,,,,,,,
Other Derivatives,,,,,,,
,Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts,,,,,,
that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies,,,,,,,
other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs,,,,,,,
are recognized in other income expense net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets,,,,,,,
and liabilities.,,,,,,,
,We  also  use  derivatives  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  interest  rates,,,,,,
commodity prices credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally from time to time we enter into,,,,,,,
derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains losses arising from,,,,,,,
"these  derivatives  are  reflected  within  the  ""other""  component  of  other  income  expense  net  and  the  offsetting",,,,,,,
recognized  gains  losses  on,,the  marketable  equity  securities  are  reflected  within,,,,the  gain  loss  on  equity,
securities net component of other income expense net. See Note 6 for further details on other income expense,,,,,,,
