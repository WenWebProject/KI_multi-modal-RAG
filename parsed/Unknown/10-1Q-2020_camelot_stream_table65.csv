â€¢,the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular
,geographies.
,From  time  to  time  certain  of  these  factors  have  adversely  affected  our  advertising  revenue  to  varying  degrees.  The  occurrence  of  any  of  these  or  other
factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising,
with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example macroeconomic conditions have affected and we expect,
will  continue  to  affect  marketers'  ability  or  willingness  to  spend  with  us as  we have  seen  with  the  regional  and  worldwide  economic  disruption  related  to  the,
COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic have resulted in reduced demand for our ads a,
related decline in pricing of our ads and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services which may impair our,
ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.,
Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do,
not  control  and  changes  to  the  regulatory  environment  third-party  mobile  operating  systems  and  browsers  and  our  own  products  have  impacted  and  we,
expect will continue to impact the availability of such signals which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.,
,We rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our
advertising  revenue  is  dependent  on  targeting  and  measurement  tools  that  incorporate  these  signals  and  any  changes  in  our  ability  to  use  such  signals  will,
adversely  affect  our  business.  For  example  legislative  and  regulatory  changes  such  as  the  GDPR  and  CCPA  have  impacted  and  we  expect  will  continue  to,
impact our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In addition mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google have announced,
product  changes  as  well  as  future  plans  to  limit  the  ability  of  application  developers  to  use  these  signals  to  target  and  measure  advertising  on  their  platforms.,
Similarly we have implemented and may continue to implement product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads,
and other experiences on our products and services including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide offering of product changes we implemented in,
connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and any additional loss of,
such signals in the future will adversely affect our targeting and measurement capabilities and negatively impact our advertising revenue.,
Our  user growth  engagement  and monetization  on  mobile  devices  depend  upon effective  operation  with mobile  operating  systems  networks  technologies,
products and standards that we do not control.,
,The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to
feature Facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the,
interoperability of Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control,
such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with,
mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products',
functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver,
target  or  measure  the  effectiveness  of  ads  or  charge  fees  related  to  the  distribution  of  our  products  or  our  delivery  of  ads  could  adversely  affect  the  usage  of,
Facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of,
third-party cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization and we expect that any similar changes to its,
Google's or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally in,
order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and,
standards  that  we  do  not  control  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers  mobile  carriers  and  browser  developers.  We  may  not  be,
successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these,
technologies products systems networks or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on their,
mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use Facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to,
Facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of,
our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our,
relationships with the operators of,
