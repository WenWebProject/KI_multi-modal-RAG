,Further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances,,,
we  can  transfer  process  and/or  receive  personal  data  as  well  as  ongoing  enforcement  actions  from  supervisory,,,,
authorities  related  to  cross-border  transfers  of  personal  data.  The  validity  of  various  data  transfer  mechanisms  we,,,,
currently rely upon remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments globally which may require us to,,,,
adapt our existing arrangements.,,,,
,We  face  and  may  continue  to  face  intellectual  property  infringement  or  misappropriation  violation  of,,,
rights  of  publicity  and  other  claims  that  could  be  costly  to  defend  result  in  significant  damage  awards  or,,,,
other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to use certain technologies.,,,,
,We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations,,,
"of 
infringement  or  other  violations  of",,intellectual  property  rights,including  patent  copyright,trade  secrets  and
trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts,,,,
and  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  ITC  for  exclusion  and  cease-and-desist  orders.  In  addition  patent-,,,,
holding  companies  may  frequently  seek  to  generate  income  from  patents  they  have  obtained  by  bringing  claims,,,,
against us. As we continue to expand our business the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased,,,,
and  may  continue  to  increase  as  we  develop  and  acquire  new  products  services  and  technologies  including  AI,,,,
technologies.,,,,
,Adverse  results  in  any  of  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing,,,
agreements if licenses are available at all or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or,,,,
elsewhere  including  by  preventing  us  from  offering  certain  features  functionalities  products  or  services  in  certain,,,,
jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues,,,,
for us and otherwise harm our business.,,,,
,Many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  including  certain  suppliers  require  us  to  defend,,,
against  certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  and  in  some  cases  indemnify  them  for  certain  intellectual,,,,
"property 
infringement  claims  against",them  which  could  result,in,increased  costs,for  defending  such  claims  or
significant  damages  if  there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  Such  customers  and  partners  may  also,,,,
discontinue  the  use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a  result  of  injunctions  or  otherwise  which  could,,,,
result  in  loss  of  revenues  and  harm  our  business.  Moreover  intellectual  property  indemnities  provided  to  us  by  our,,,,
suppliers  when  obtainable  may  not  cover  all  damages  and  losses  suffered  by  us  and  our  customers  arising  from,,,,
intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in,,,,
the  future  agree  to  provide  indemnification  for  certain  potential  liabilities  including  those  associated  with  intellectual,,,,
property  claims.  Regardless  of  their  merits  intellectual  property  claims  are  often  time  consuming  and  expensive  to,,,,
litigate  or  settle. To  the  extent  such  claims  are  successful  they  could  harm  our  business  including  our  product  and,,,,
service offerings financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or,,,
exposure to additional tax liabilities.,,,,
,We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.,,,
Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with,,,,
different statutory tax rates net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk,,,,
management  program  changes  in  our  stock  price  for  shares  issued  as  employee  compensation  changes  in  the,,,,
valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax,,,,
laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws. Further if we are,,,,
unable  or  fail  to  collect  taxes  on  behalf  of  customers  employees  and  partners  as  the  withholding  agent  we  could,,,,
become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.,,,,
,We  are  subject  to  regular  review  and  audit  by  both  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities. As  a  result  we  have,,,
received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions such,,,,
as  transfer-pricing  adjustments  or  permanent-establishment  claims. Any  adverse  outcome  of  such  a  review  or  audit,,,,
could harm our financial condition and operating results require adverse changes to our business practices or subject,,,,
us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income,,,,
taxes  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  significant  judgment  and  often  involves  uncertainty.  Although  we  believe  our,,,,
estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements,,,,
and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.,,,,
,Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions,,,
may  be  subject  to  significant  changes  in  ways  that  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  For,,,,
example various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital,,,,
services taxes and other targeted taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax,,,,
