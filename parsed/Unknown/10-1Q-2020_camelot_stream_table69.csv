For example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our,,,,
ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in generating,,,,
profits,in  connection  with  these  efforts.,In  addition,the  introduction  of  new  products  or  changes  to  existing  products,may  result  in  new  or  enhanced
governmental  or regulatory  scrutiny  or other complications  that  could adversely  affect  our business and financial  results.  We have also invested  and expect  to,,,,
continue  to  invest  significant  resources  in  growing  our  WhatsApp  and  Messenger  products  to  support  increasing  usage  of  such  products.  We  have  historically,,,,
monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the,,,,
long term. In addition we have announced plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services as well as facilitate interoperability between,,,,
these  platforms  which  plans  have  drawn  governmental  and  regulatory  scrutiny  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  If  our  new  or  enhanced  products  fail  to  engage  users,,,,
marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or,,,,
other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected.,,,,
We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.,,,,
,We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with,,,
our  mission  and  benefit  the  aggregate  user  experience  and  will  thereby  improve  our  financial  performance  over  the  long  term.  For  example  we  have  recently,,,,
implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has,,,,
to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business. For example our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to,,,,
place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites which will reduce our ability to deliver the most,,,,
relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly from time to time we update our News Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these changes,,,,
have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook which could adversely affect our,,,,
financial  results.  From  time  to  time  we  may  also  change  the  size  frequency  or  relative  prominence  of  ads  in  order  to  improve  ad  quality  and  overall  user,,,,
experience. In addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of,,,,
publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook. We also may introduce new features or other changes,,,,
to existing products or introduce new stand-alone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of,,,,
monetization. For example we plan to continue to promote the Stories format which is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products but,,,,
our advertising efforts with this format are still under development and we do not currently monetize Stories at the same rate as News Feed. In addition as we,,,,
focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products from time to time these efforts have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement,,,,
with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. These decisions,,,,
may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.,,,,
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business,,,,
and financial results may be harmed.,,,,
,We  believe  that  our  brands  have  significantly  contributed  to  the  success  of  our  business.  We  also  believe  that  maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brands  is,,,
critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will,,,,
depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully. We may introduce,,,,
new  products  or  terms  of  service  or  policies  that  users  do  not  like  which  may  negatively  affect  our  brands.  Additionally  the  actions  of  our  developers  or,,,,
advertisers  may  affect  our  brands  if  users  do  not  have  a  positive  experience  using  third-party  mobile  and  web  applications  integrated  with  our  products  or,,,,
interacting  with  parties  that  advertise  through  our  products.  We  will  also  continue  to  experience  media  legislative  or  regulatory  scrutiny  of  our  actions  or,,,,
decisions regarding user privacy encryption content advertising and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID-19,,,,
pandemic which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. For example in March 2018 we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data,,,,
by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the,,,,
sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise address user concerns which has occurred,,,,
in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or,,,,
inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate,,,,
