New  or  changing  laws  and  regulations  or  interpretations  or  applications  of  existing  laws  and  regulations  in  a
manner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations and/or our practices have resulted in and
may continue to result in less useful products and services altered business models and operations limited ability to
pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services substantial costs and civil or criminal liability.
Examples include laws and regulations regarding:
"•
Competition  and  technology  platforms’  business  practices:  Laws  and  regulations 
focused  on 
large"
technology  platforms  including  the  Digital  Markets  Act  in  the  European  Union  EU;  regulations  and  legal
settlements  in  the  U.S.  South  Korea  and  elsewhere  that  affect  Google  Play’s  billing  policies  fees  and
business model; as well as litigation and new and expected regulations in a range of jurisdictions including
among others in the UK Japan and India.
"•
AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development use and provision of AI technologies and other digital"
products and services which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example the
EU  AI  Act  came  into  force  on  August  1  2024  and  will  generally  become  fully  applicable  after  a  two-year
transitional  period  although  certain  obligations  will  take  effect  at  an  earlier  or  later  time.  The  EU  AI  Act
introduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU
including  specific  transparency  and  other  requirements  for  general  purpose AI  systems  and  the  models  on
which  those  systems  are  based.  In  the  U.S.  there  is  increasing  uncertainty  as  to  the  federal  government's
approach  to AI  regulation  going  forward  as  the  continued  applicability  of  the  White  House's  2023  Executive
Order  on  the  Safe  Secure  and Trustworthy  Development  and  Use  of Artificial  Intelligence  which  lays  out  a
framework  for  the  U.S.  government  among  other  things  to  monitor  private  sector  development  of  certain
foundation  models  remains  subject  to  regulatory  development.  Several  states  are  considering  enacting  or
have already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies including those focused on consumer
protection and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level some states may move to regulate
AI  model  development  and  deployment.  Further  at  the  federal  and  state  level  there  have  been  various
proposals and in some cases laws enacted addressing “deepfakes” and other AI-generated synthetic media.
"•
Data privacy collection processing and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection"
processing and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data including privacy and data protection laws; laws
affecting  the  processing  of  children's  data  as  discussed  further  below  data  breach  notification  laws;  laws
limiting  data  transfers  including  data  localization  laws;  and  laws  requiring  data  portability  including  the  EU
Data Act as discussed further below.
"•
Copyright  and  other 
intellectual  property:  Copyright  and  related 
laws 
including 
the  EU  Directive  on"
Copyright  in  the  Digital  Single  Market  and  European  Economic Area  transpositions  which  have  introduced
new  licensing  regimes  increase  liability  with  respect  to  content  uploaded  by  users  or  linked  to  from  our
platforms  or  create  property  rights  in  news  publications  that  could  require  payments  to  news  agencies  and
publishers which may result in other regulatory actions.
"•
Content  moderation:  Various 
laws  covering  content  moderation  and 
removal  and 
related  disclosure"
obligations  such  as  the  EU's  Digital  Services Act  Florida’s  Senate  ill  7072  and  Texas’  House  ill  20  and
laws and proposed legislation in Singapore Australia and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure
to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and
algorithms  which  may  make  it  harder  for  services  like  Google  Search  and YouTube  to  detect  and  deal  with
low-quality deceptive or harmful content or on the other hand may impinge on the rights of free expression
which  in  turn  could  impact  how  our  platforms  are  viewed  by  users. Additionally  legislators  are  increasingly
focused on regulating online child safety including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age.
These regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to
operate and monitor minors’ experiences on our products and services.
"•
Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers which could"
result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.
In  addition  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations  as  interpreted  by  courts
regulators  or  administrative  bodies  remain  uncertain  and  could  be  interpreted  in  ways  that  harm  our  business.  For
example we rely on statutory safe harbors like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230
of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Services Act in Europe to protect against liability for
various linking caching ranking recommending and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe
harbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending
litigation in the U.S. EU and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and
"online  platforms.  Our  development  use  and  commercialization  of  AI  products  and  services 
including  our"
