QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES AOUT MARKET RISK",
,We  are  exposed  to  financial  market  risks  including  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  interest  rates
and equity investment risks.,
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,
,We  transact  business  globally  in  multiple  currencies.  International  revenues  as  well  as  costs  and  expenses
denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the,
"U.S.  dollar.  As  discussed  below  we  enter 
into  derivative 
instruments 
to  hedge",foreign  currency  risk.  Principal
currencies  hedged  included  the Australian  dollar  ritish  pound  Canadian  dollar  Euro  and  Japanese  yen.  For  the,
purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange,
rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in  exchange  rates  of  10  could  be,
experienced.,
,We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities
denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  subsidiary.  These  forward  and  option  contracts,
reduce  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  assets  and,
liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E which are offset,
by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.,
,If  an  adverse  10  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  total  monetary  assets  liabilities  and
commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have,
resulted  in  an  adverse  effect  on  income  before  income  taxes  of  approximately  136  million  and  503  million  as  of,
December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for,
the years ended December 31 2022 and 2023.,
,We  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  including  collars  an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a
combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  When  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens  gains  from  foreign  currency  forward  and  option,
contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens losses from foreign,
currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These  hedging,
contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate,
these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot,
rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassify them,
into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2022 and 2023 the amount recorded in AOCI related to
our  cash  flow  hedges  before  tax  effect  would  have  been  approximately  1.3  billion  and  1.5  billion  lower  as  of,
December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a,
corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.,
,We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency
risks  related  to  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  These  forward  contracts  serve  to  offset  the  foreign  currency,
translation risk from our foreign operations.,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment CTA within AOCI
related to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 903 million and 946 million,
lower as of December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to,
offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.,
Interest Rate Risk,
,Our  Corporate  Treasury  investment  strategy  is  to  achieve  a  return  that  will  allow  us  to  preserve  capital  and
"maintain 
liquidity.  We 
invest  primarily 
in  debt  securities",including  government  bonds  corporate  debt  securities
"mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities  money  market  and  other 
funds","time  deposits  and 
interest  rate"
derivatives. y policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and,
floating  rate  interest  earning  securities  carry  a  degree  of  interest  rate  risk.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  fair,
market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income,
than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to,
interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt,
securities  we  have  elected  the  fair  value  option  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  are  recorded  in  OI&E.  We  measure,
securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until,
the securities are sold less any expected credit losses.,
