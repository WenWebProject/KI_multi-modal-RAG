Software Development Costs
"We  expense  software  development  costs 
including  costs 
to  develop  software  products  or 
the  software"
component  of  products  to  be  sold  leased  or  marketed  to  external  users  before  technological  feasibility  is  reached.
Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result development
costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.
Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and
cloud  based  applications  used  to  deliver  our  services.  We  capitalize  development  costs  related  to  these  software
applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the
software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were
not material for the periods presented.
Stock-based Compensation
"Stock-based  compensation  primarily  consists  of  Alphabet  restricted  stock  units  ""RSUs"".  RSUs  are  equity"
classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense
using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.
For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us
on  behalf  of  our  employees.  As  a  result  fewer  shares  are  issued  than  the  number  of  RSUs  outstanding  and  the  tax
withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
Additionally stock-based compensation also includes other stock-based awards such as performance stock units
"""PSUs""  and  awards  that  may  be  settled  in  cash  or  the  stock  of  certain  Other  ets.  PSUs  and  certain  Other  et"
awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other et awards are
liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other et awards is based on the
equity valuation of the respective Other et.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We  expense  advertising  and  promotional  costs  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred.  For  the  years  ended
December  31  2018  2019  and  2020  advertising  and  promotional  expenses  totaled  approximately  6.4  billion  6.8
billion and 5.4 billion respectively.
Performance Fees
Performance  fees  refer  to  compensation  arrangements  with  payouts  based  on  realized  investment  returns.  We
recognize  compensation  expense  based  on  the  estimated  payouts  which  may  result  in  expense  recognized  before
investment  returns  are  realized.  Performance  fees  which  are  primarily  related  to  gains  on  equity  securities  are
recorded as a component of other income expense net.
Certain Risks and Concentrations
Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly
changing. In addition our revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world. Significant
changes  in  this  industry  or  changes  in  customer  buying  or  advertiser  spending  behavior  could  adversely  affect  our
operating results.
No  individual  customer  or  groups  of  affiliated  customers  represented  more  than  10  of  our  revenues  in  2018
"2019  or  2020. 
In  2018  2019  and  2020  we  generated  approximately  46  46  and  47  of  our  revenues"
respectively from customers based in the U.S.
We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents marketable securities
foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment
of our counterparty creditworthiness credit limits and use of collateral management.
Cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  consist  primarily  of  time  deposits  money  market  and  other  funds
