Note 3. Financial Instruments
Debt Securities
We classify our marketable debt securities which are accounted for as available-for-sale within Level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models
utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.
For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are
recorded  in  other  income  expense  net.  The  fair  value  option  was  elected  for  these  securities  to  align  with  the
unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net gains related to debt securities still held
where we have elected the fair value option were 87 million as of December 31 2020. As of December 31 2020 the
fair value of these debt securities was 2 billion. alances as of December 31 2019 were not material.
The following tables summarize our debt securities for which we did not elect the fair value option by significant
investment categories as of December 31 2019 and 2020 in millions:
