our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research
tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of
such items. ased upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we do not anticipate a material change to
such amounts within the next 12 months.
In July 2016 we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency Notice from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with
the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent
to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15 2020 the IRS filed its
Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions of
the trial began in February 2020 and additional sessions are expected to continue later in the year. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to
apply the revised adjustment to future years. ased on the information provided we believe that if the IRS prevails in its updated position this could result in an
additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately 9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return
plus interest and any penalties asserted.
In March 2018 we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its
position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain
tax  credits  that  we  claimed.  If  the  IRS  prevails  in  its  position  for  these  new  adjustments  this  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability  of  up  to
approximately 680 million in  excess  of  the  amounts  in  our  originally  filed  U.S.  returns  plus  interest  and  any  penalties  asserted.  We  do  not  agree  with  the
positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.
We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 Income Taxes that is lower than the potential
additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition if the IRS prevails in its positions
related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under
the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act. As of March 31 2020 we have not resolved these
matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.
We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or
other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is
reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that
are  subject  to  examination  in  various  jurisdictions  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  full  range  of  possible  adjustments  to  the  balance  of  gross  unrecognized  tax
benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position results of operations and cash flows.
