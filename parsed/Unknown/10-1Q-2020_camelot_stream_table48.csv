decrease was mostly due to the 3.0 billion legal accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to our FTC settlement partially offset by an increase of 193,,,,,,,
million in bad debt expense a majority of which was due to an increase in our estimated credit losses as the result of economic slowdown caused by the COVID-,,,,,,,
