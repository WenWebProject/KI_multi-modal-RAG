•,any additional dividend liquidation redemption sinking fund and other rights and restrictions applicable to the
,preferred stock.
Holders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive when as and if declared by our oard of Directors cash dividends at the rates,
and on the dates established by such series of preferred stock. Dividend rates may be fixed or variable or both. Different series of,
preferred stock may be entitled to dividends at different dividend rates or based upon different methods of determination. Each,
dividend will be payable to the holders of record as they appear on our stock books on record dates determined by our oard of,
Directors. Dividends on preferred stock may be cumulative or noncumulative. If our oard of Directors fails to declare a dividend,
on any preferred stock for which dividends are noncumulative then the right to receive that dividend will be lost and we will have,
no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.,
Any series of preferred stock may be redeemable in whole or in part at our option. In addition any series of preferred stock may be,
subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a sinking fund.,
Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and ylaws and of Delaware Law,
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and ylaws and of the DGCL could have the effect of delaying deferring or,
discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. In particular our capital structure concentrates ownership of our voting,
stock in the hands of Larry Sergey and Eric. These provisions which are summarized below are expected to discourage coercive,
takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire,
control of us to first negotiate with our oard of Directors. However these provisions could also have the effect of discouraging,
others from attempting hostile takeovers and as a consequence they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of,
our Class A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These,
provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it,
more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.,
Three Classes of Stock,
As discussed above our Class  Common Stock has 10 votes per share while our Class A Common Stock has one vote per share,
and our Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights unless otherwise required by law. As a result of their ownership of a,
substantial portion of our Class  Common Stock Larry and Sergey currently have the ability to elect all of our directors and to,
determine the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated voting control could discourage,
others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as,
beneficial.,
ecause the Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights except as required by law the issuance of Class C Capital Stock will not,
result in voting dilution to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class  Common Stock. As a result the issuance of,
Class C Capital Stock could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their,
ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.,
So long as Larry and Sergey have the ability to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders,
third parties may be deterred in their willingness to make an unsolicited merger takeover or other change of control proposal or to,
engage in a proxy contest for the election of directors. As a result our three classes of stock may have the effect of depriving our,
stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace,
our directors and management.,
