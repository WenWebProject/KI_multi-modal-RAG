Software Development Costs,,
We  expense  software  development  costs,including  costs,"to  develop  software  products  or 
the  software"
component  of  products  to  be  sold  leased  or  marketed  to  external  users  before  technological  feasibility  is  reached.,,
Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result development costs,,
that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.,,
,Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and,
cloud-based  applications  used  to  deliver  our  services.  We  capitalize  development  costs  related  to  these  software,,
applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the,,
software  will  be  used  to  perform  the  function  intended.  Costs  capitalized  for  developing  such  software  applications,,
were not material for the periods presented.,,
Stock-based Compensation,,
,Stock-based  compensation  primarily  consists  of  Alphabet,"restricted  stock  units 
RSUs.  RSUs  are  equity"
classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense,,
using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.,,
,For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be,
paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and,,
the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.,,
,Additionally  stock-based  compensation  includes  other  stock-based  awards  such  as  performance  stock  units,
PSUs that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other ets. PSUs,,
and certain Other et awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain,,
Other et awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other et,,
awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other et.,,
Advertising and Promotional Expenses,,
,We  expense  advertising  and  promotional  costs  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred.  For  the  years  ended,
December  31  2020  2021  and  2022  advertising  and  promotional  expenses  totaled  approximately  5.4  billion  7.9,,
billion and 9.2 billion respectively.,,
Performance Fees,,
,Performance  fees  refer  to  compensation  arrangements  with  payouts  based  on  realized  returns  from  certain,
investments.  We  record  compensation  expense  based  on  the  estimated  payouts  on  an  ongoing  basis  which  may,,
result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use,,
of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income expense net.,,
Fair Value Measurements,,
,Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a,
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such fair value is a market-based measurement that,,
is  determined  based  on  assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  an  asset  or  a  liability. Assets  and,,
