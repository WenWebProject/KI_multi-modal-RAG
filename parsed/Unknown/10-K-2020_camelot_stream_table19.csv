Our  international  operations  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  business  our  financial
condition and operating results.
Our  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow
internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  53  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2020.  In
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the
following:
"•
Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent"
us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.
"•
Import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from"
offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies
and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs.
"•
Longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud."
"•
Evolving foreign events including the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may"
adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  new  regulatory  costs  and  challenges  including  the
transfer  of  personal  data  between  the  EU  and  the  United  Kingdom  and  new  customer  requirements  in
addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.
"•
Anti-corruption  laws  such  as  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  local  laws  prohibiting  certain"
payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties.
"•
Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of"
legal precedent.
"•
Different employee/employer relationships existence of works councils and labor unions and other challenges"
caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.
ecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars
we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international
currency  exposure  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.  dollar  and  foreign  currencies  may
adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  earnings  particularly  in  light  of  market  volatilities  due  to  COVID-19.  Hedging
programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and
operating results.
Risks Related to our Industry
People  access  the  Internet  through  a  variety  of  platforms  and  devices  that  continue  to  evolve  with  the
advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of
our products and services developed for these interfaces our business could be harmed.
People  access  the  Internet  through  a  growing  variety  of  devices  such  as  desktop  computers  mobile  phones
"smartphones 
laptops  and 
tablets  video  game  consoles  voice-activated  speakers  wearables  automobiles  and"
television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer
or  distributor  may  establish  unique  technical  standards  for  its  devices  and  our  products  and  services  may  not  be
available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result.
Some  manufacturers  may  also  elect  not  to  include  our  products  on  their  devices.  In  addition  search  queries  are
increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers apps social media or other platforms which could harm
our  business.  It  is  hard  to  predict  the  challenges  we  may  encounter  in  adapting  our  products  and  services  and
developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating
and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial
number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users or failing to develop products and
technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating
results and ability to capture future business opportunities.
Data  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating  to  our  technology  and  our  practices  could  damage  our
reputation  cause  us  to  incur  significant  liability  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from
using  our  products  and  services.  Software  bugs  or  defects  security  breaches  and  attacks  on  our  systems
could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers’
ability to use our products and services harming our business operations and reputation.
