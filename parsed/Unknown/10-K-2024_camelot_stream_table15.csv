as  building  AI  capabilities  into  new  and  existing  products  and  services  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to  innovate  and,,,,,,,
provide products and services that are helpful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers. Our,,,,,,,
investments  ultimately  may  not  be  commercially  viable  or  may  not  result  in  an  adequate  return  of  capital  and  in,,,,,,,
pursuing new strategies we may incur unanticipated liabilities.,,,,,,,
,We  have  invested  significantly  and  expect  to  continue  to  invest  significantly  in  our  property  and  equipment,,,,,,
including our technical infrastructure and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful,,,,,,,
lives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to ongoing business operations changes in the planned,,,,,,,
use and utilization of assets and/or technological advancements could indicate a change in the period over which we,,,,,,,
expect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.,,,,,,,
,Innovations  in  our  products  and  services  could  also  result  in  changes  to  user  behavior  and  affect  our  revenue,,,,,,
trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of resources and management,,,,,,,
attention from current operations different monetization models and the use of alternative investment governance or,,,,,,,
compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their,,,,,,,
objectives.,,,,,,,
,Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in devices including our smartphones home devices and,,,,,,
wearables  which  is  a  highly  competitive  market  with  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services  rapid,,,,,,,
adoption  of  technological  advancements  by  competitors  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries  short,,,,,,,
product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in performance characteristics and price and,,,,,,,
feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and  businesses. There  can  be  no  assurance  we  will  be  able  to  provide,,,,,,,
devices that compete effectively.,,,,,,,
,Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,,,,,,
including  Google  Cloud  Platform  and  Google  Workspace  and  we  are  advancing  our  AI  platforms  and  models  to,,,,,,,
support  these  tools  and  technologies.  We  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud,,,,,,,
computing  services  invest  in  cybersecurity  and  hire  talent  particularly  to  support  and  scale  our  sales  force. At  the,,,,,,,
same  time  our  competitors  are  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  cloud-based  services.  Pricing  including  platform,,,,,,,
switching costs are challenging across the industry and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving and,,,,,,,
we may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further our business with financial services healthcare and,,,,,,,
public sector customers may present additional risks including regulatory compliance risks. For instance we may be,,,,,,,
subject to government audits and cost reviews and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to,,,,,,,
legal,financial  and/or,reputational,risks.  Evolving,laws  and,regulations  may,require  us,to  make  new  capital
investments build new products and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries and we may not be,,,,,,,
able to meet sovereign operating requirements.,,,,,,,
,Within Other ets we are investing significantly in areas such as health life sciences and transportation among,,,,,,
others. These  investment  areas  face  intense  competition  from  large  experienced  and  well-funded  competitors  and,,,,,,,
our offerings many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies may not be successful or be,,,,,,,
able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.,,,,,,,
,In  addition  new  and  evolving  products  and  services  including  those  that  use  AI  raise  ethical  technological,,,,,,
legal  regulatory  and  other  challenges  which  may  negatively  affect  our  brands  and  demand  for  our  products  and,,,,,,,
services. ecause all of these investment areas are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies,,,,,,,
and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,,,,
,Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over  time  and  we  may  experience  downward  pressure  on  our,,,,,,
operating margin in the future.,,,,,,,
,Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over  time  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  factors  including  changes  in  the,,,,,,
devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines,,,,,,,
in advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing,,,,,,,
demand  for  new  technologies;  decreases  in  the  pricing  of  our  products  and  services;  ongoing  product  and  policy,,,,,,,
changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.,,,,,,,
,In addition we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,,,,,,
such as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services in particular from the continued expansion of our,,,,,,,
business,"into  new 
fields",,including  products  and  services  such  as  our  devices  Google  Cloud  and  consumer,,,,
subscription products as well as significant investments in Other ets all of which may have margins lower than those,,,,,,,
we generate from advertising. In particular margins on our devices have had and may continue to have an adverse,,,,,,,
effect  on  our  consolidated  margins  due  to  pressures  on  pricing  and  higher  cost  of  sales.  We  may  also  experience,,,,,,,
downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increasing costs,,,,,,,
