,We  maintain  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  accounts  receivable  which  is  recorded  as  an  offset  to  accounts,,
receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of,,,
Income.  We  assess  collectibility  by  reviewing  accounts  receivable  on  a  collective  basis  where  similar  characteristics,,,
exist  and  on  an  individual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or  collectibility  issues.  In,,,
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status,,,
and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider,,,
customer-specific information current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic,,,
conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data.,,,
,For  the  year  ended  December  31  2020  our  assessment  considered  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  estimates  of,,
expected credit and collectibility trends. Volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict,,,
and  may  cause  variability  and  volatility  that  may  have  a  material  impact  on  our  allowance  for  credit  losses  in  future,,,
periods. The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was 275 million and 789 million as of December 31,,,
2019 and 2020 respectively.,,,
Inventory,,,
,Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is,,
computed using the first-in first-out method.,,,
Non-Marketable Investments,,,
,We  account  for  non-marketable  equity  investments  through  which  we  exercise  significant  influence  but  do  not,,
have control over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under,,,
the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative,,,
the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  investments  is  adjusted  to  fair  value  for  observable  transactions  for,,,
identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  or  impairment.  Adjustments  are  determined  primarily  based  on  a,,,
market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income expense net.,,,
,Non-marketable debt investments are classified as available-for-sale securities.,,
,Non-marketable  investments  that  do  not  have  stated  contractual  maturity  dates  are  classified  as  non-current,,
assets on the Consolidated alance Sheets.,,,
Impairment of Investments,,,
,We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity investments for impairment.,,
,For  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss  position  we  determine  whether  a  credit  loss  exists.  The  credit  loss  is,,
estimated  by  considering  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectibility  of  the  security  and  information  about  past,,,
events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other,,,
income expense net not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss,,,
"are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ""AOCI"". If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely",,,
than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized,,,
cost  basis  we  will  write  down  the  security  to  its  fair  value  and  record  the  corresponding  charge  as  a  component  of,,,
other income expense net.,,,
For  non-marketable  equity  securities  we  consider  whether,impairment,indicators  exist  by  evaluating,the
companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  access  to  capital  resources  and  the  time  since  the  last  adjustment  to  fair,,,
value among others. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its,,,
fair  value  by  recording  the  corresponding  charge  as  a  component  of  other  income  expense  net.  Fair  value  is,,,
estimated using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.,,,
Variable Interest Entities,,,
,We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in,,
"which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity ""VIE"". We consolidate VIEs when we",,,
are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that,,,
most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their,,,
losses  or  benefits.  If  we  are  not  the  primary  beneficiary  in  a  VIE  we  account  for  the  investment  or  other  variable,,,
interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.,,,
,Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination,,
of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary.,,,
