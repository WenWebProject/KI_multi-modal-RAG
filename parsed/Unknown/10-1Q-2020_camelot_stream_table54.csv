For accounts receivable measured at amortized cost we use aging analysis probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are
most relevant  to evaluating  and estimating  the expected  credit  losses. These macroeconomic  variables  may vary by geography customer-type  or industry sub-
vertical.  The  contractual  life  of  our  trade  accounts  receivable  is  generally  short-term;  however  we  may  experience  increasing  credit  loss  risks  from  accounts
receivable  in  future  periods  depending  on  the  duration  or  degree  of  economic  slowdown  caused  by  COVID-19  pandemic  and  our  actual  experience  in  the
future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.
