Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased 4.5 billion and 7.2 billion from the three and nine months ended
September 30 2022 to the three and nine months ended September 30 2023 respectively. The overall growth was
driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage
on  mobile  devices;  growth  in  advertiser  spending  and  improvements  we  have  made  in  ad  formats  and  delivery.
"Growth  was  adversely  affected  by  changes 
in 
foreign  currency  exchange  rates 
for 
the  nine  months  ended"
September 30 2023 particularly during the first six months of the year.

"YouTube  ads  revenues 
increased  881  million  and  1.0  billion 
from 
the 
three  and  nine  months  ended"
September 30 2022 to the three and nine months ended September 30 2023 respectively. The growth was driven
by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products both of which benefited from
increased  spending  by  our  advertisers.  Growth  was  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange
rates for the nine months ended September 30 2023 particularly during the first six months of the year.

decrease  in  Google Ad  Manager  and AdSense  revenues. Additionally  Google  Network  revenues  were  adversely
