,As  of  September  30  2023  we  had  64.9  billion  of  remaining  performance  obligations  “revenue  backlog”,,,,,,,
primarily  related  to  Google  Cloud.  Our  revenue  backlog  represents  commitments  in  customer  contracts  for  future,,,,,,,,
services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue. The  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  for  these,,,,,,,,
commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant  contract  terms  and  when  our,,,,,,,,
customers  utilize  services  which  could  affect  our  estimate  of  revenue  backlog  and  when  we  expect  to  recognize,,,,,,,,
such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24,,,,,,,,
"months  with 
the  remaining",to  be  recognized,,thereafter.  Revenue  backlog,,,includes  related  deferred  revenue,,
currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original,,,,,,,,
expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.,,,,,,,,
Deferred Revenues,,,,,,,,

including  amounts  which  are  refundable.  Deferred  revenues  primarily  relate  to  Google  Cloud  and  Google  other.,,,,,,,,
Total deferred revenue as of December 31 2022 was 4.5 billion of which 2.3 billion was recognized as revenues,,,,,,,,
during the nine months ended September 30 2023.,,,,,,,,
