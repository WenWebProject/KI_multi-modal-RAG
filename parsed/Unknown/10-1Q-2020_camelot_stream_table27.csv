Share-based Compensation Plans
We maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan which was amended in each of June 2016 and February 2018
Amended 2012 Plan and the 2005 Stock Plan collectively Stock Plans. Our Amended 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides
for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options restricted stock awards stock appreciation rights RSUs performance shares and stock bonuses to
qualified employees directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock
Plan. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our Stock Plans are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012
Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
Share-based compensation expense consists of our RSU expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general
our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite
service period.
Effective January 1 2020 there were 171 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. The
number of shares reserved for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the
Amended 2012 Plan which will continue through April 2026 by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of i 2.5 of the total issued
and  outstanding  shares  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  as  of  the  immediately  preceding  December  31st  or  ii  a  number  of  shares  determined  by  our  board  of
