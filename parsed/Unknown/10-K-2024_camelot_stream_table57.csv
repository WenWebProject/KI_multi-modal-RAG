,We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency,,
risks  related  to  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  These  forward  contracts  serve  to  offset  the  foreign  currency,,,
translation risk from our foreign operations.,,,

related to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 946 million and 660 million,,,

Interest Rate Risk,,,
,Our  Corporate  Treasury  investment  strategy  is  to  achieve  a  return  that  will  allow  us  to  preserve  capital  and,,
"maintain 
liquidity.  We",invest  primarily,in  debt  securities,including  government  bonds  corporate  debt  securities
mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities  money  market  and  other,,funds,"time  deposits  and 
interest  rate"
derivatives. y policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and,,,
floating  rate  interest  earning  securities  carry  a  degree  of  interest  rate  risk.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  fair,,,
market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income,,,
than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to,,,
interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt,,,
securities  we  have  elected  the  fair  value  option  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  are  recorded  in  OI&E.  We  measure,,,
securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until,,,
the securities are sold less any expected credit losses.,,,
,We use value-at-risk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value,,
of  our  investment  portfolio.  The  VaR  is  the  expected  loss  in  fair  value  for  a  given  confidence  interval  for  our,,,
investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95,,,
confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31 2023 and,,,
2024 are shown below in millions:,,,
