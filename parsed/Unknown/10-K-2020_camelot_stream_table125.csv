Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  management  recognizes  that  any
controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
