Given our levels of share-based compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.
The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which our
stock  price  is  higher  than  the  grant  price  of  the  share-based  compensation  vesting  in  that  period  we  will  recognize  excess  tax  benefits  that  will  decrease  our
effective tax rate. For example in the three months ended March 31 2020 excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision
for income taxes by 86 million and our effective tax rate by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our
stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-
based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective
tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax
rate and adversely affect our financial results.
Our  business  is  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  regarding  privacy  data  protection  content  competition  consumer
protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to
our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business.
We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States  and  abroad  that  involve  matters  central  to  our  business  including  privacy  data
protection  and  personal  information  rights  of  publicity  content  intellectual  property  advertising  marketing  distribution  data  security  data  retention  and
deletion  data  localization  and  storage  data  disclosure  electronic  contracts  and  other  communications  competition  protection  of  minors  consumer  protection
telecommunications  product  liability  e-commerce  taxation  economic  or  other  trade  prohibitions  or  sanctions  anti-corruption  law  compliance  securities  law
compliance and online payment services. The introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take
may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny. In addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and
regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.
These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are
constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often
uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and
inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users
or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services
or adversely affect our financial results.
We are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process and/or receive certain data that
is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example
in  2016  the  European  Union  and  United  States  agreed  to  a  transfer  framework  for  data  transferred  from  the  European  Union  to  the  United  States  called  the
Privacy Shield but this framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also is subject to challenge by regulators and
private parties including a pending legal challenge by a private party. In addition the other bases upon which Facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such
data  such as  Standard  Contractual  Clauses SCCs have  been  subjected  to  regulatory  and  judicial  scrutiny.  For example  the Court  of  Justice  of the  European
Union is currently considering the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by
the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe India and other jurisdictions regarding the August
2016  update  to  WhatsApp's  terms  of  service  and  privacy  policy  and  its  sharing  of  certain  data  with  other  Facebook  products  and  services  including  a  lawsuit
currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from Europe to the United States is invalidated or the
transfer frameworks are amended if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from
sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect
our financial results.
Proposed  or  new  legislation  and  regulations  could  also  significantly  affect  our  business.  For  example  the  European  General  Data  Protection  Regulation
GDPR  took  effect  in  May  2018  and  applies  to  all  of  our  products  and  services  used  by  people  in  Europe.  The  GDPR  includes  operational  requirements  for
companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As a
result we implemented
