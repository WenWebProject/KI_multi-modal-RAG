Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents
and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in U.S. government securities U.S.
government agency securities and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 60.29 billion as of  March 31 2020 an
increase of 5.43 billion from  December 31 2019. The increase was mostly due to 11.0 billion of cash generated  from operations  offset  by  3.66 billion for
capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases 1.25 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and  690 million of taxes paid
related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units RSU awards.
Cash paid for income taxes was 209 million in the three months ended March 31 2020. As of March 31 2020 our federal net operating loss carryforward
was  9.35  billion  and  we  anticipate  that  none  of  this  amount  will  be  utilized  to  offset  our  federal  taxable  income  in  2020.  As  of  March  31  2020  we  had
324 million of federal tax credit carryforward of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2020.
In  May  2016  we  entered  into  a  2.0 billion senior  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  and  any  amounts  outstanding  under  the  facility  will  be  due  and
payable on May 20 2021. As of March 31 2020 no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.
Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an
expiration  date.  As  of  December  31  2019  4.90  billion  remained  available  and  authorized  for  repurchases.  In  January  2020  an  additional  10.0  billion of
repurchases was authorized under this program. During the three months ended March 31 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired 6 million shares of our
Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of 1.24 billion. As of March 31 2020 13.66 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.
As of March 31 2020 14.69 billion of the 60.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The
Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result earnings in
foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.
In July 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices which was
approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. The settlement requires us to pay a penalty of 5.0 billion which is included in accrued expenses and
other  current  liabilities  on  our  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  March  31  2020.  We  paid  the  penalty  in  April  2020  upon  the  effectiveness  of  the
modified consent order.
We currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the
foreseeable future.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities during the three months ended  March 31 2020 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items
such as 1.60 billion of depreciation and amortization and  1.34 billion of share-based compensation expense and cash collected from accounts receivable. The
majority of the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the three months ended March 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to the
increases in net income and cash collected from accounts receivables partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash  used  in  investing  activities  during  the  three months  ended  March  31  2020 consisted  mostly  of  3.56  billion of  net  purchases  of  property  and
equipment  as  we  continued  to  invest  in  data  centers  servers  office  buildings  and  network  infrastructure  and  476  million of  net  purchases  of  marketable
securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was mostly due
to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities.
