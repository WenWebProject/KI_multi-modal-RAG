Software Development Costs,,
We  expense  software  development  costs,including  costs,"to  develop  software  products  or 
the  software"
component  of  products  to  be  sold  leased  or  marketed  to  external  users  before  technological  feasibility  is  reached.,,
Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result development costs,,
that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.,,
,Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and,
cloud-based  applications  used  to  deliver  our  services.  We  capitalize  development  costs  related  to  these  software,,
applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the,,
software  will  be  used  to  perform  the  function  intended.  Costs  capitalized  for  developing  such  software  applications,,
were not material for the periods presented.,,
Stock-based Compensation,,
,Stock-based compensation SC primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units RSUs. RSUs are equity,
classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense,,
using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.,,
,For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be,
paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and,,
the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.,,
,Additionally  SC  includes  other  stock-based  awards  such  as  performance  stock  units  PSUs  that  include,
market  conditions  and  awards  that  may  be  settled  in  cash  or  the  stock  of  certain  Other  et  companies.  PSUs  and,,
certain  awards  granted  by  Other  et  companies  are  equity  classified  and  expense  is  recognized  over  the  requisite,,
service  period.  Certain  awards  granted  by  Other  et  companies  are  liability  classified  and  remeasured  at  fair  value,,
through settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other et companies is based on the equity valuation of the,,
respective Other et company.,,
Advertising and Promotional Expenses,,
,We  expense  advertising  and  promotional  costs  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred.  For  the  years  ended,
December  31  2021  2022  and  2023  advertising  and  promotional  expenses  totaled  approximately  7.9  billion  9.2,,
billion and 8.7 billion respectively.,,
Performance Fees,,
,Performance  fees  refer  to  compensation  arrangements  with  payouts  based  on  realized  returns  from  certain,
investments.  We  record  compensation  expense  based  on  the  estimated  payouts  on  an  ongoing  basis  which  may,,
result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use,,
of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.,,
Fair Value Measurements,,
,Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a,
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such fair value is a market-based measurement that,,
is  determined  based  on  assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  an  asset  or  a  liability. Assets  and,,
liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based,,
on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:,,
