stockholders may consider favorable.,
,Provisions  in Alphabet’s  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a
change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:,
•,Our oard of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the oard of
,Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director.
•,Our stockholders may not act by written consent which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding
,a stockholders' meeting.
•,Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of
,minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
•,Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the oard of Directors or to
,propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter
,a  potential  acquirer  from  conducting  a  solicitation  of  proxies  to  elect  the  acquirer's  own  slate  of  directors  or
,otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
