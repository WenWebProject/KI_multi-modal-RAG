8.    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
8.1        Awards  of  SARs.  A  Stock  Appreciation  Right  “SAR”  is  an  award  to  an  eligible  Employee  Consultant  or  Non-
Employee Director that may be settled in cash or Shares which may consist of Restricted Stock having a value equal to a the difference
between the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price multiplied by b the number of Shares with respect to which
the SAR is being settled subject to any maximum number of Shares that may be issuable as specified in an Award Agreement. All SARs
shall be made pursuant to an Award Agreement.
8.2    Terms of SARs. The Committee will determine the terms of each SAR including without limitation: a the number of
Shares subject to the SAR; b the Exercise Price and the time or times during which the SAR may be settled; c the consideration to be
distributed on settlement of the SAR; and d the effect of the Participant’s Termination on each SAR. The Exercise Price of the SAR will be
determined  by  the  Committee  when  the  SAR  is  granted  and  may  not  be  less  than  Fair  Market  Value.  A  SAR  may  be  awarded  upon
satisfaction of Performance Factors if any during any Performance Period as are set out in advance in the Participant’s individual Award
Agreement.  If  the  SAR  is  being  earned  upon  the  satisfaction  of  Performance  Factors  then  the  Committee  will:  x  determine  the  nature
length and starting date of any Performance Period for each SAR; and y select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure
the  performance  if  any.  Performance  Periods  may  overlap  and  Participants  may  participate  simultaneously  with  respect  to  SARs  that  are
subject to different Performance Factors and other criteria.
8.3        Exercise  Period  and  Expiration  Date.  A  SAR  will  be  exercisable  within  the  times  or  upon  the  occurrence  of  events
determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement governing such SAR. The SAR Agreement shall set forth the expiration
date; provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten 10 years from the date the SAR is granted. The Committee may
also provide for SARs to become exercisable at one time or from time to time periodically or otherwise including without limitation upon
the attainment during a Performance Period of performance goals based on Performance Factors in such number of Shares or percentage of
the Shares subject to the SAR as the Committee determines. Except as may be set forth in the Participant’s Award Agreement vesting ceases
on such Participant’s Termination Date unless determined otherwise by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing the rules of Section
5.6 also will apply to SARs.
8.4    Form of Settlement. Upon exercise of a SAR a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an
amount  determined  by  multiplying  i  the  difference  between  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  a  Share  on  the  date  of  exercise  over  the  Exercise
Price; times ii the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the Committee the payment from the
Company for the SAR exercise may be in cash in Shares of equivalent value or in some combination thereof. The portion of a SAR being
settled may be paid currently or on a deferred basis with such interest or dividend equivalent if any as the Committee determines provided
that the terms of the SAR and any deferral satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
8.5        Termination. Except as  may  be set forth in  the Participant’s Award  Agreement vesting  ceases  on such Participant’s
Termination Date unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
