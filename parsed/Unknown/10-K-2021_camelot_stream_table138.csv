of any PSUs under a Grant the Participant shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Grant an,
amount equal to the dividends or other distributions that would have been paid or issued on the number of,
shares of Capital Stock actually vested and issuable to Participant pursuant to such Grant had they been,
