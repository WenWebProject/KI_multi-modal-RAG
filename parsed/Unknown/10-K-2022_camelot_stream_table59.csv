the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with,,,,,,,,
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies,,,,,,,,
and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the,,,,,,,,
transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  2  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are,,,,,,,,
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting,,,,,,,,
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations,,,,,,,,
of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  3  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely,,,,,,,,
detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on,,,,,,,,
the financial statements.,,,,,,,,

Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become,,,,,,,,
inadequate because of  changes in conditions  or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may,,,,,,,,
deteriorate.,,,,,,,,
