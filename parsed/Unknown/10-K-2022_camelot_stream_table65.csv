assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.,,
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our,,
estimates  including  those  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses;  fair  values  of  financial  instruments  intangible,,
assets  and  goodwill;  inventory;  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  and  property  and  equipment;  income  taxes;  and,,
contingent liabilities among others. We base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that,,
are believed to be reasonable and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values,,
of assets and liabilities.,,
,In  January  2023  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and,
adjusted  the  estimated  useful  life  of  our  servers  from  four  years  to  six  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain,,
network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year,,
