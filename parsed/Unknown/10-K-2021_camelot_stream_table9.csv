generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones the Fitbit Charge 5 Chromecast with Google
TV and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey
that we are investing in for the long run.
The key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy security and user choice. We protect
user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design and that keep users in control
of  their  data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the
Internet evolves so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in
Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18
months.  And  we  continue  to  keep  users  and  their  passwords  safe  through  advances  like  our  built-in  password
manager.
