revenues  were  both  substantially  consistent  from  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30  2021  to  the  three,
and nine months ended September 30 2022.,
,The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30 2021 to the three months

costs followed by hardware costs and content acquisition costs.,
