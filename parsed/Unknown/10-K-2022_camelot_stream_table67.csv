We  offer  advertising  by  delivering  both  performance  and  brand  advertising.  We,"recognize 
revenues 
for"
performance  advertising  when  a  user  engages  with  the  advertisement  such  as  a  click  a  view  or  a  purchase.  For,
brand advertising we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad.,
,For ads placed on Google Network properties we evaluate whether we are the principal i.e. report revenues on
a gross basis or agent i.e. report revenues on a net basis. Generally we report advertising revenues for ads placed,
on Google Network properties on a gross basis that is the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,
and  amounts  paid  to  Google  Network  partners  are  recorded  as  cost  of  revenues.  Where  we  are  the  principal  we,
control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to,
monetize  the  advertising  inventory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers  and  is  further  supported  by  us  being,
primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.,
