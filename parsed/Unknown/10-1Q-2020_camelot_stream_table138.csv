Jurisdiction-Specific Addendum
This Jurisdiction-Specific Addendum the “Addendum” includes additional or if so indicated different terms and conditions that govern the RSUs if Participant
is subject to the laws of one or more of the jurisdictions listed herein. If Participant is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction or is considered as such for local law
purposes other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working or if Participant transfers to another jurisdiction after being granted the RSUs
the Company will in its discretion determine the extent to which the terms and conditions contained herein will be applicable to Participant.
This  Addendum  also  includes  notifications  relating  to  issues  of  which  Participant  should  be  aware  with  respect  to  his  or  her  participation  in  the  Plan.  The
information is based on the securities exchange control and other laws in effect in the jurisdictions as of January 2020. Such laws are often complex and change
frequently. As a result Participant should not rely on the information in this Addendum as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her
participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time the RSUs vest or are settled or at the time Participant sells Shares acquired under
the Plan. In addition the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to Participant’s particular situation and the Company is not in a position to assure
Participant of any particular result. Accordingly Participant should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the laws in the relevant jurisdictions may apply
to  Participant’s  situation.  If  Participant  is  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  jurisdiction  or  is  considered  as  such  for  local  law  purposes  other  than  the  one  in  which
Participant is currently working and/or residing or if Participant transfers to another jurisdiction after being granted the RSUs the information contained herein
may not be applicable to Participant in the same manner.
This  Addendum  forms  part  of  the  Agreement  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Agreement  and  the  Plan.  Unless  otherwise  defined  herein  the  terms
defined in the Plan or the Agreement as applicable shall have the same defined meanings in this Addendum.
