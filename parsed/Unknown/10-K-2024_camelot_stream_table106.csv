Android:  In  July  2018  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google’s  Android-related"
"distribution  agreements 
infringed  European  antitrust 
laws 
imposed  a  €4.3  billion 
fine  and  directed 
the"
termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our
Android distribution practices. In September 2022 the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the
fine  from  €4.3  billion  to  €4.1  billion.  We  subsequently  appealed  the  General  Court's  affirmation  of  the  EC
decision  with  the  European  Court  of  Justice  which  remains  pending.  In  2018  we  recognized  a  charge  of
5.1 billion for the fine which we reduced by 217 million in 2022.

AdSense  for  Search:  In  March  2019  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google's"
agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws imposed a fine of €1.5 billion
and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements which we implemented prior to the
decision.  In  2019  we  recognized  a  charge  of  1.7  billion  for  the  fine  and  appealed  the  EC  decision.  In
September 2024 the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has
appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.

Search: In October 2020 the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District"
Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  relating  to  Search  and
Search  advertising.  In  August  2024  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  ruled  that  Google
violated  such  U.S.  antitrust  laws. A  separate  proceeding  is  being  held  to  determine  remedies  the  range  of
which  vary  widely. The  DOJ  has  proposed  a  high  level  remedy  framework  which  includes  alterations  to  our
products  and  services  and  our  business  models  and  operations  including  structural  remedies  and/or  our
distribution arrangements among other changes some of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect
a decision likely in the second half of 2025 after which we intend to appeal.
Further  in  June  2022  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  and  in  October  2023  the
Japanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.
Given the nature of these matters we cannot estimate a possible loss.

Advertising  Technology:  In  December  2020  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S."
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state
deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally
in January 2023 the DOJ along with a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District
"Court 
for 
the  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  alleging 
that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust 
laws  relating 
to 
its"
advertising  technology  and  a  number  of  additional  state Attorneys  General  subsequently  joined  the  lawsuit.
The trial ended in September 2024 and we expect a decision in early 2025.
Further in June 2023 the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that
Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology to which we responded.
Given the nature of these matters we cannot estimate a possible loss.

Google Play: In July 2021 a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the"
Northern  District  of  California  alleging  that  Google’s  operation  of  Android  and  Google  Play  violated  U.S.
antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023 we reached a settlement
in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the
settlement  remains  pending  before  the  court.  In  May  2024  we  funded  the  settlement  amount  to  an  escrow
agent.
In December 2023 a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated
U.S.  antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play's  business.  Epic  did  not  seek  monetary  damages.  The  presiding
judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and
operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial
court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our
request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this
matter we cannot estimate a possible loss.
