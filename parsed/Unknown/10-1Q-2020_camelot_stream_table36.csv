Trends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography
We calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital
goods are purchased or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the
average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue the number of MAUs used
in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The share of revenue from users who are not also
Facebook  or  Messenger  MAUs  was  not  material.  The  geography  of  our  users  affects  our  revenue  and  financial  results  because  we  currently  monetize  users  in
different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due
to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example ARPU in the first quarter of 2020 in the United States & Canada region was
more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.
