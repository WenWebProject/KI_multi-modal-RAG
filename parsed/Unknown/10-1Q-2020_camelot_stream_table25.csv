Note 9. Long-term Debt
In  May  2016  we  entered  into  a  2.0 billion senior  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility  and  any  amounts  outstanding  under  this  facility  will  be  due  and
payable on May 20 2021. As of March 31 2020 no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this facility.
Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
Guarantee
In  2018  we  established  a  multi-currency  notional  cash  pool  for  certain  of  our  entities  with  a  third-party  bank  provider.  Actual  cash  balances  are  not
physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement the bank extends overdraft credit to
our participating entities as needed provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the
unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook Inc.
Other contractual commitments
We also have 7.62 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of March 31 2020 the majority of which is related to network infrastructure and
our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years.
Legal Matters
eginning on March 20 2018 multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere
against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws breach of fiduciary duties and other causes of action in connection with
our  platform  and  user  data  practices  as  well  as  the  misuse  of  certain  data  by  a  developer  that  shared  such  data  with  third  parties  in  violation  of  our  terms  and
policies and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. eginning on July 27 2018 two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United
States  against  us and certain  of our directors  and officers  alleging  violations  of securities  laws in connection  with the  disclosure  of our earnings  results  for the
second  quarter  of  2018  and  seeking  unspecified  damages.  These  two actions  subsequently  were  transferred  and  consolidated  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the
Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25 2019 the
district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action with leave to amend. On November 15 2019 an amended complaint
was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them. In addition our
platform and user data practices as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission
FTC state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the United States Europe and other jurisdictions. In July 2019 we entered into a settlement and
modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters our settlement
with  the  FTC  requires  us  to  pay  a  penalty  of  5.0 billion and  to  significantly  enhance  our  practices  and  processes  for  privacy  compliance  and  oversight.  This
penalty is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31 2020. We paid the penalty in
April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order.
On April 1 2015 a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users alleging
"that the ""tag suggestions"" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois iometric Information Privacy Act and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On"
April 16 2018 the district court certified a class of Illinois residents and on May 14 2018 the district court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.
On May 29 2018 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On
August 8 2019 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2 2019 we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of
the decision of the Ninth Circuit which was denied. On January 15 2020 the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit which will require a
payment of 550 million by us and is subject to approval by the district court. This settlement amount is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31 2020.
eginning  on  September  28  2018  multiple  putative  class  actions  were  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  against  us
