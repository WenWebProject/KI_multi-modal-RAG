costs  to  content  providers.  We  may  also  face  an  increase  in  infrastructure  costs  supporting  businesses  such  as,
Search  Google  Cloud  and  YouTube.  Many  of  our  expenses  are  less  variable  in  nature  and  may  not  correlate  to,
changes in revenues.,
,Due  to  these  factors  and  the  evolving  nature  of  our  business  our  historical  revenue  growth  rate  and  historical
operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance.,
,Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of
our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.,
,Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for
us.  Various  events  outside  of  our  control  pose  a  threat  to  our  intellectual  property  rights  as  well  as  to  our  products,
services and technologies. For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country,
in  which  our  products  and  services  are  distributed  or  made  available  through  the  Internet.  Also  the  efforts  we  have,
taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for,
our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover we may not have,
adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore there is,
always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued,
patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.,
,We  also  seek  to  maintain  certain  intellectual  property  as  trade  secrets.  The  secrecy  of  such  trade  secrets  and
other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting,
from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example there is a risk that the word,
“Google”  could  become  so  commonly  used  that  it  becomes  synonymous  with  the  word  “search.”  Some  courts  have,
"ruled  that  ""Google""  is  a  protectable  trademark  but  it  is  possible  that  other  courts  particularly  those  outside  of  the",
United States may reach a different determination. If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which,
could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand.,
,Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.
Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of,
our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.,
,Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our
ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners.,
,Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the
brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch,
new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users advertisers customers content providers and,
other  partners.  Our  brands  may  be  negatively  affected  by  a  number  of  factors  including  among  others  reputational,
issues third-party content shared on our platforms data privacy and security issues and developments and product or,
technical  performance  failures.  For  example  if  we  fail  to  appropriately  respond  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or,
objectionable  content  on  our  services  and/or  products  or  objectionable  practices  by  advertisers  or  to  otherwise,
adequately address user concerns our users may lose confidence in our brands.,
,Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business financial condition and
operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide,
high-quality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.,
,We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could harm our
financial condition operating results and prospects.,
,We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability
to supply both our products and our internet-based services.,
,We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products to design certain of our components
and parts and to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected,
if  we  are  not  able  to  engage  these  companies  with  the  necessary  capabilities  or  capacity  on  reasonable  terms  or  if,
those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse,
changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.,
,We  have  experienced  and/or  may  experience  supply  shortages  and  price  increases  driven  by  raw  material
component or part availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations tariffs trade disputes,
