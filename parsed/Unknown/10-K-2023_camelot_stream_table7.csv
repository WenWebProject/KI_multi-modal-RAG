133 languages in Google Translate; and organization searching and editing in Google Photos.,,,,
,Large  language  models  LLMs  are  an  exciting  aspect  of  our  work  in AI  based  on  deep  learning  architectures,,,
"such  as 
the  Transformer  a  neural  network  architecture",that  we,introduced,in  2017,"that  helped  with

understanding. This led to the idirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or ERT in 2019 that helped,,,,
Search understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.,,,,
,Google  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud  and  we  continue  to  invest  in  our  Google  Cloud  offerings  including,,,
Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-,,,,
optimized infrastructure mature AI platform and world-class models and assistive agents.,,,,
,We  believe  AI  can  solve  some  of  the  hardest  societal  scientific  and  engineering  challenges  of  our  time.  For,,,
example  in  2020  Google  DeepMind’s AlphaFold  system  solved  a  50-year-old  protein  folding  challenge.  Since  then,,,,
we have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work,,,,
on  everything  from  accelerating  new  malaria  vaccines  to  advancing  cancer  drug  discovery  and  developing  plastic-,,,,
eating enzymes. As another example AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful,,,,
information  predicting  climate-related  events  and  optimizing  climate  action.  Using  advanced  AI  and  geospatial,,,,
analysis  Google  Research  has  developed  flood  forecasting  models  that  can  provide  early  warning  and  real-time,,,,
flooding information to communities and individuals.,,,,
,As AI continues to improve rapidly we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we,,,
deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold,,,,
and responsible approach we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.,,,,
Deliver the Most Advanced Safe and Responsible AI,,,,
,We  aim  to  build  the  most  advanced  safe  and  responsible  AI  with  models  that  are  developed  trained  and,,,
rigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023 we,,,,
launched Gemini our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal which means,,,,
it  can  generalize  and  seamlessly  understand  operate  across  and  combine  different  types  of  information  including,,,,
text code audio images and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini as well as other AI models we,,,,
have previously developed and announced across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences,,,,
for our users advertisers partners customers and developers.,,,,
,We  believe  our  approach  to  AI  must  be  both  bold  and  responsible.  That  means  developing  AI  in  a  way  that,,,
maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges guided by our AI Principles. We published,,,,
these in 2018 as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use users safety and avoidance,,,,
of harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible we,,,,
believe it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively.,,,,
,Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud,,,
,AI  is  not  only  a  powerful  enabler  it  is  also  a  major  platform  shift.  Globally  businesses  from  startups  to  large,,,
enterprises  and  the  public  sector  are  thinking  about  how  to  drive  transformation.  That  is  why  we  are  focused  on,,,,
making  it  easy  and  scalable  for  others  to  innovate  and  grow  with  AI.  That  means  providing  the  most  advanced,,,,
computing  infrastructure  and  expanding  access  to  Google’s  latest AI  models  that  have  been  rigorously  tested  in  our,,,,
own products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train tune augment and deploy applications using,,,,
generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides,,,,
pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write test document and operate software.,,,,
,Improve Knowledge Learning Creativity and Productivity,,,
,Things  that  we  now  consider  routine  –  like  spell  check  mobile  check  deposit  or  Google  Search  Google,,,
Translate and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly we are focused on giving helpful features,,,,
to  our  users  as  we  continue  to  deliver  on  our  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it  universally,,,,
accessible and useful.,,,,
,While we have been integrating AI into our products for years we are now embedding the power of generative AI,,,
to  continue  helping  our  users  express  themselves  and  get  things  done.  For  example  Duet AI  in  Google  Workspace,,,,
helps  users  write  organize  visualize  accelerate  workflows  and  have,,,richer  meetings.  ard  allows  users,to
collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities coding support and app integration.,,,,
Dream  Screen  a  new  experimental  feature  in  YouTube  allows  for  the  creation  of  AI-generated  video  or  image,,,,
