stockholders may consider favorable.,
,Provisions  in  Alphabet’s  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a
change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:,
•,Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure Larry
,and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of
,directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets.
,This  concentrated  control  could  discourage  others  from  initiating  any  potential  merger  takeover  or  other
,change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above the issuance of
,the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey.
•,Our oard of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the oard of
,Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill
,vacancies on our oard of Directors.
•,Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result a holder or holders controlling a majority of our
,capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.
•,Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of
,minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
•,Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the oard of Directors or to
,propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter
,a  potential  acquirer  from  conducting  a  solicitation  of  proxies  to  elect  the  acquirer's  own  slate  of  directors  or
,otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
•,Our oard of Directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock. The
,ability  to  issue  undesignated  preferred  stock  makes  it  possible  for  our  oard  of  Directors  to  issue  preferred
,stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
