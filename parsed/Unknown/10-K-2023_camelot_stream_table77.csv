changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the
same  issuer. Adjustments  are  determined  primarily  based  on  a  market  approach  as  of  the  transaction  date  and  are
recorded as a component of OI&E.
Non-marketable  securities  that  do  not  have  effective  contractual  maturity  dates  are  classified  as  other  non-
current assets on the Consolidated alance Sheets.
Derivative Financial Instruments
See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.
Accounts Receivable
Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or
services  offered.  The  term  between  invoicing  and  when  payment  is  due  is  not  significant.  For  certain  products  or
"services  and  customers  we 
require  payment  before 
the  products  or  services  are  delivered 
to 
the  customer."
Additionally  accounts  receivable  includes  amounts  for  services  performed  in  advance  of  the  right  to  invoice  the
customer.
We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable which is recorded as an offset to accounts
receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics
exist  and  on  an  individual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or  collectibility  issues.  In
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status
and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider
customer-specific information current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions.
Other
Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into
commercial  arrangements  at  or  near  the  same  time.  For  these  transactions  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the
"substance  of 
the  arrangements 
including  assessing  whether 
the  components  of 
the  arrangements  should  be"
accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP and determining the value of the components of
the  arrangements  including  the  fair  value  of  the  investments.  Additionally  if  our  investment  in  such  companies
becomes impaired any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.
Impairment of Investments
We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.
For  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss  position  we  determine  whether  a  credit  loss  exists. The  credit  loss  is
estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past
events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E
not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If
we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized
loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis we will write down the security to its fair value and record the
corresponding charge as a component of OI&E.
For  non-marketable  equity  securities  including  equity  method  investments  we  consider  whether  impairment
indicators  exist  by  evaluating  the  companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  and  access  to  capital  resources  among
other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair
value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the
fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.
Inventory
Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is
computed using the first-in first-out method.
Variable Interest Entities
We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in
which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE. We consolidate VIEs when we are
the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most
significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses
