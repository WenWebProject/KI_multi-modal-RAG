,Revenue in the three months ended March 31 2020 increased 2.66 billion or 18 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was almost entirely,,,,,,,
due to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad.,,,,,,,,
,During the three months ended March 31 2020 the number of ads delivered increased by 39 as compared with approximately 32 in the same period in,,,,,,,
2019. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users and,,,,,,,,
their engagement. During the three months ended March 31 2020 the average price per ad decreased by 16 as compared with a decrease of approximately 4,,,,,,,,
in  the  same  period  in  2019.  The  decrease  in  average  price  per  ad  was  primarily  driven  by  a  decrease  in  advertising  demand  globally  due  to  the  COVID-19,,,,,,,,
pandemic  over  the  last  three  weeks  of  the  quarter.  To  a  lesser  extent  the  decrease  in  average  price  per  ad  was  also  caused  by  an  increasing  proportion  of  the,,,,,,,,
number of ads delivered as Stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates. In the near-term we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will,,,,,,,,
be determined primarily by the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown result in a decrease in advertising demand.,,,,,,,,
Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue,,,,,,,,
,The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the three months ended March 31 2020 compared to the same period in,,,,,,,
2019 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the three months ended March 31 2020 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates,,,,,,,,
for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 18.01 billion and  17.71 billion,,,,,,,,
respectively. Using these constant rates total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 275 million and 274 million higher than actual total revenue and,,,,,,,,
advertising revenue respectively for the three months ended March 31 2020.,,,,,,,,
