Indemnifications,,,,,
,In the normal course of business including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate,,,,
activities  we,indemnify  certain  parties,,,including  advertisers  Google  Network  partners  distribution  partners,
customers of Google Cloud offerings lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed,,,,,
to  hold  certain  parties  harmless  against  losses  arising  from  a  breach  of  representations  or  covenants  or  out  of,,,,,
intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the,,,,,
time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition we have entered into,,,,,
indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations,,,,,
to our agents.,,,,,
,It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification,,,,
agreements  due,to,the  unique,facts  and  circumstances,involved,"in  each  particular  agreement.  Additionally 
the"
payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,,,,,
cash  flows  or  financial  position.  However  to  the  extent  that  valid  indemnification  claims  arise  in  the  future  future,,,,,
payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows,,,,,
in a particular period.,,,,,
,As of December 31 2022 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably,,,,
possible.,,,,,
Legal Matters,,,,,
,We  record  a  liability  when  we  believe  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be,,,,
reasonably  estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be,,,,,
estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect,,,,,
the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been  previously  accrued  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible  losses,,,,,
disclosed and make adjustments as appropriate.,,,,,
,Certain  outstanding  matters  include  speculative  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts.  Significant,,,,
judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related,,,,,
to such matters and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of,,,,,
outstanding,legal  matters  are,,inherently  unpredictable  and  subject,,to  significant  uncertainties  and  could  either
individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect.,,,,,
,We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.,,,,
