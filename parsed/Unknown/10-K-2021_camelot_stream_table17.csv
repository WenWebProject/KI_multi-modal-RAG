,Our  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow
internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  54  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2021.  In,
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the,
following:,
•,restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent
,us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;
•,import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from
,offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies
,and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs;
•,longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
•,an  evolving  foreign  policy  landscape  that  may  adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  new
,regulatory  costs  and  challenges  including  the  transfer  of  personal  data  between  the  EU  and  the  United
,Kingdom and new customer requirements in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively
,anticipate;
