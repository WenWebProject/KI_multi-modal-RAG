information  that  is  deemed  to  be  misleading  or  intended  to  manipulate  opinions  by  perceived  or  actual  efforts  by  governments  to  obtain  access  to  user
information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform or by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends
including for example any such actions around the pandemic the 2020 U.S. presidential election or other elections around the world. Maintaining and enhancing
our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions such as the foregoing matter
regarding developer misuse of data have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive
expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected.
Security breaches improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems or other cyber incidents could
harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.
Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Our
products and services involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches
and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from
marketers could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish
our  competitive  position.  In  addition  computer  malware  viruses  social  engineering  predominantly  spear  phishing  attacks  and  general  hacking  have  become
more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to
create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other
objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence the size of our user base the types and volume of personal data on our systems and the evolving nature of our
products and services including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and
attacks  including  from  highly  sophisticated  state-sponsored  or  otherwise  well-funded  actors.  Our  efforts  to  address  undesirable  activity  on  our  platform  also
increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or
marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the
information  we  receive  and  to  disable  undesirable  activities  on  our  platform  may  also  be  unsuccessful  due  to  software  bugs  or  other  technical  malfunctions;
employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government
surveillance;  breaches  of  physical  security  of  our  facilities  or  technical  infrastructure;  or  other  threats  that  evolve.  In  addition  third  parties  may  attempt  to
fraudulently  induce  employees  or  users  to  disclose  information  in  order  to  gain  access  to  our  data  or  our  users'  data.  Cyber-attacks  continue  to  evolve  in
sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed
to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we
cannot  assure  you  that  such  measures  will  provide  absolute  security  that  we  will  be  able  to  react  in  a  timely  manner  or  that  our  remediation  efforts  will  be
successful. We experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time and we may incur significant costs in protecting against
or remediating such incidents.
In addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided
by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with Facebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of
services provided to us. However if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their
networks our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed.
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection as well as obligations under
our modified consent order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission FTC. As a result affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory
actions  against  us in connection  with any actual  or perceived  security  breaches  or improper  access to or disclosure  of data which has occurred  in the past and
which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or
our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and
adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results.
For example in September 2018 we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user
access  tokens  which  were  then  used  to  access  certain  profile  information  from  approximately  29  million  user  accounts  on  Facebook.  While  we  took  steps  to
remediate  the  attack  including  fixing  the  vulnerability  resetting  user  access  tokens  and  notifying  affected  users  we  may  discover  and  announce  additional
developments which could further
