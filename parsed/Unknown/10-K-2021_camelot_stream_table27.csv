Alphabet Inc."
affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’
ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial
which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.
"Provisions 
in  our  charter  documents  and  under  Delaware 
law  could  discourage  a 
takeover 
that"
stockholders may consider favorable.
Provisions  in  Alphabet’s  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a
change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:
"•
Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure Larry"
and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentrated control
could  discourage  others  from  initiating  any  potential  merger  takeover  or  other  change  of  control  transaction
that other stockholders may view as beneficial.
"•
Our oard of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the oard of"
Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director.
"•
Our stockholders may not act by written consent which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding"
a stockholders' meeting.
"•
Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of"
minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
"•
Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the oard of Directors or to"
propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter
a  potential  acquirer  from  conducting  a  solicitation  of  proxies  to  elect  the  acquirer's  own  slate  of  directors  or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
"•
Our oard of Directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock which"
makes it possible for our oard of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences
that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law
a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock
unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the oard of Directors has approved the
transaction. Our oard of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
General Risks
The  continuing  effects  of  COVID-19  are  highly  unpredictable  and  could  be  significant  and  may  have  an
adverse effect on our business operations and our future financial performance.
Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization our business operations and
financial performance have been and may continue to be affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the
efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic including the introduction of
new  variants  of  COVID-19  and  vaccination  and  other  efforts  to  control  the  spread  our  revenue  growth  rate  and
expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates and our
future operating results may fall below expectations. Additionally we may experience a significant and prolonged shift
in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics.
As a result of the pandemic our workforce shifted to operating in a primarily remote working environment which
continues to create inherent productivity connectivity and oversight challenges. The effects of the ongoing pandemic
are  dynamic  and  uneven.  As  we  prepare  to  return  our  workforce  in  more  locations  back  to  the  office  we  may
experience increased costs and/or disruption as we experiment with hybrid work models in addition to potential effects
on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.
Our  operating  results  may  fluctuate  which  makes  our  results  difficult  to  predict  and  could  cause  our
results to fall short of expectations.
Our  operating  results  have  fluctuated  and  may  in  the  future  fluctuate  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  factors  many
outside  of  our  control  including  the  cyclicality  and  seasonality  in  our  business  and  geopolitical  events.  As  a  result
comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a period-to-period basis
may  not  be  meaningful  and  our  past  results  should  not  be  relied  on  as  an  indication  of  our  future  performance.
Consequently our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.
