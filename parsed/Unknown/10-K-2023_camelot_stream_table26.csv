Further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances
we  can  transfer  process  and/or  receive  personal  data  as  well  as  ongoing  enforcement  actions  from  supervisory
authorities  related  to  cross-border  transfers  of  personal  data.  The  validity  of  various  data  transfer  mechanisms  we
currently rely upon remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. which
may require us to adapt our existing arrangements.
We face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend
result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to
use certain technologies.
We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations
"of 
infringement  or  other  violations  of 
intellectual  property  rights 
including  patent  copyright 
trade  secrets  and"
trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts
and  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  ITC  for  exclusion  and  cease-and-desist  orders.  In  addition  patent-
holding  companies  may  frequently  seek  to  generate  income  from  patents  they  have  obtained  by  bringing  claims
against us. As we continue to expand our business the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased
and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products services and technologies.
Adverse  results  in  any  of  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing
agreements if licenses are available at all or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or
elsewhere  including  by  preventing  us  from  offering  certain  features  functionalities  products  or  services  in  certain
jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues
for us and otherwise harm our business.
Many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  including  certain  suppliers  require  us  to  defend
against  certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  and  in  some  cases  indemnify  them  for  certain  intellectual
"property 
infringement  claims  against 
them  which  could  result 
in 
increased  costs 
for  defending  such  claims  or"
significant  damages  if  there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  Such  customers  and  partners  may  also
discontinue  the  use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a  result  of  injunctions  or  otherwise  which  could
result  in  loss  of  revenues  and  harm  our  business.  Moreover  intellectual  property  indemnities  provided  to  us  by  our
suppliers  when  obtainable  may  not  cover  all  damages  and  losses  suffered  by  us  and  our  customers  arising  from
intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in
the  future  agree  to  provide  indemnification  for  certain  potential  liabilities  including  those  associated  with  intellectual
property  claims.  Regardless  of  their  merits  intellectual  property  claims  are  often  time  consuming  and  expensive  to
litigate  or  settle. To  the  extent  such  claims  are  successful  they  could  harm  our  business  including  our  product  and
service offerings financial condition and operating results.
Expectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities increased costs and
reputational harm.
We  are  subject  to  laws  regulations  and  other  measures  that  govern  a  wide  range  of  topics  including  those
"related 
to  matters  beyond  our  core  products  and  services.  For 
instance  new 
laws 
regulations  policies  and"
international accords relating to ESG matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are
"being  developed  and 
formalized 
in  Europe 
the  U.S.  and  elsewhere  which  may  entail  specific 
target-driven"
"frameworks  and/or  disclosure 
requirements.  We  have 
implemented 
robust  ESG  programs  adopted 
reporting"
frameworks and principles and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and
initiatives may require considerable investments and our goals with all of their contingencies dependencies and in
certain  cases  reliance  on  third-party  verification  and/or  performance  are  complex  and  ambitious  and  may  change.
We  cannot  guarantee  that  our  goals  and  initiatives  will  be  fully  realized  on  the  timelines  we  expect  or  at  all  and
projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure or perceived failure by
us  to  adhere  to  our  public  statements  comply  fully  with  developing  interpretations  of  ESG  laws  and  regulations  or
meet  evolving  and  varied  stakeholder  expectations  and  standards  could  harm  our  business  reputation  financial
condition and operating results.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or
exposure to additional tax liabilities.
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with
different statutory tax rates net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk
management  program  changes  in  our  stock  price  for  shares  issued  as  employee  compensation  changes  in  the
valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax
laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws. Further if we are
