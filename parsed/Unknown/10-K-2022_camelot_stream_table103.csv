Non-Income Taxes,
,We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The
subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the,
sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue,
non-income taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when,
a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of,
loss  can  be  estimated  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and  uncertainty  of,
these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially  different  from  our,
expectations.,
For information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.,
