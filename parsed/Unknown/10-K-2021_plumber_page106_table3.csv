Generally a business combination includes a merger asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the
interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who owns 15 or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting
securities or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder
status did own 15 or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting securities and affiliates and associates of such person. The
existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our oard of Directors does not approve in
advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of capital
stock held by stockholders.
