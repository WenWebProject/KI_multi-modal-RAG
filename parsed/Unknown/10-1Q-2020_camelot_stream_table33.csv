Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or
mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. These measures
have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted
our  business  and  results  of  operations.  We  have  seen  a  significant  increase  in  the  size  of  our  user  base  and  user  engagement  as  a  result  of  these  preventative
measures. At the same time we experienced a significant reduction in the demand for advertising as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads over the last
three weeks of the first quarter of 2020. After the initial steep decrease in our advertising revenue growth rates in March compared to earlier in the first quarter of
2020 we have seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April where advertising revenue has been approximately flat compared to the same period
a year ago down from the 17 year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2020. We expect that we will lose at least some of the increased user engagement
when various shelter-in-place restrictions are relaxed in the future. In addition the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as well as our overall results
of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2020 or longer and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of
such impact with any certainty. We also intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities and we anticipate that additional investments
in our data center capacity network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth and certain initiatives related to the
COVID-19 pandemic will continue to drive expense growth in 2020.
