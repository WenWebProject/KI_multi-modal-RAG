quarter  of  2020  our  total  expenses  grew  35  year-over-year  after  excluding  the  3.0  billion  legal  accrual  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019  related  to  our  FTC,
settlement which is approximately twice the rate of our advertising revenue growth. If this trend persists for a significant period of time our operating margin and,
profitability will be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition to the impact on our advertising business and,
operating margin the pandemic exposes our business operations and workforce to a variety of other risks including:,
•,our inability to sustain the significant increase in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging products whether as a
,result of the lapse of shelter-in-place measures or otherwise;
•,decreased user engagement as a result of users' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services;
•,interruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage or product changes we
,implement to maintain accessibility of our services such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;
•,delays  in  product  development  or  releases  or  reductions  in  manufacturing  production  and  sales  of  consumer  hardware  as  a  result  of  inventory
,shortages supply chain shortages or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to COVID-19;
•,increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with
,our terms contracts or policies misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms election interference or other undesirable
,activity;
•,adverse  impacts  to  our  efforts  to  combat  misuse  of  our  products  and  services  and  user  data  as  a  result  of  limitations  on  our  safety  security  and
,content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks
,that our workforce is unable to perform;
•,our inability to recognize revenue collect payment or generate future revenue from marketers including from those that have been or may be forced
,to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;
