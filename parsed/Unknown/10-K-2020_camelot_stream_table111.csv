disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of,
liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make,
adjustments  as  appropriate.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  likelihood  of  there  being  and  the,
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.,
,With respect to our outstanding matters based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of
reasonably  possible  loss  will  not  either  individually  or  in  aggregate  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows. However the outcome of such matters is inherently,
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.,
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.,
Non-Income Taxes,
,We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The
subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the,
sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue,
non-income taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when,
a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of,
loss  can  be  estimated  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and  uncertainty  of,
these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially  different  from  our,
expectations.,

Note 11. Stockholders' Equity,
Convertible Preferred Stock,
,Our  oard  of  Directors  has  authorized  100  million  shares  of  convertible  preferred  stock  0.001  par  value
issuable in series. As of December 31 2019 and 2020 no shares were issued or outstanding.,
Class A and Class  Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock,
,Our oard of Directors has authorized three classes of stock Class A and Class  common stock and Class C
capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical except with respect,
to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class  common stock,
is  entitled  to  10  votes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has  no  voting  rights  except  as  required  by  applicable  law.,
Shares  of  Class    common  stock  may  be  converted  at  any  time  at  the  option  of  the  stockholder  and  automatically,
convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.,
Share Repurchases,
,In  July  2020  the  oard  of  Directors  of  Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  an  additional
28.0  billion  of  its  Class  C  capital  stock.  The  repurchases  are  being  executed  from  time  to  time  subject  to  general,
business  and  market  conditions  and  other  investment  opportunities  through  open  market  purchases  or  privately,
negotiated  transactions  including  through  Rule  10b5-1  plans.  The  repurchase  program  does  not  have  an  expiration,
date.,
,During the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired 15.3 million and
21.5  million  shares  of  Alphabet  Class  C  capital  stock  for  an  aggregate  amount  of  18.4  billion  and  31.1  billion,
respectively.,
Note 12. Net Income Per Share,
,We compute net income per share of Class A and Class  common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-
class  method.  asic  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  outstanding,
during  the  period.  Diluted  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  and  the,
effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted,
stock  units  and  other  contingently  issuable  shares.  The  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  restricted  stock  units  and  other,
contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The,
computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class  common,
stock  while  the  diluted  net  income  per  share  of  Class    common  stock  does  not  assume  the  conversion  of  those,
shares.,
,The rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our Class A and Class  common stock
and Class C capital stock are identical except with respect to voting. Furthermore there are a number of,
