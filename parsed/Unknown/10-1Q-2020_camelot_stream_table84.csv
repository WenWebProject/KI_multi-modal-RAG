We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and
our other products.
We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with
Facebook  and  our  other  products.  Such  existing  and  prospective  developers  may  not  be  successful  in  building  growing  or  monetizing  mobile  and/or  web
applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by
third parties rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives
of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain
such developers. For example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook and
our  other  products  with  the  objective  of  enhancing  the  user  experience  and  such  actions  have  reduced  distribution  from  user  engagement  with  and  our
monetization  opportunities  from  mobile  and  web  applications  integrated  with  our  products.  In  addition  as  part  of  our  efforts  related  to  privacy  safety  and
security we are conducting investigations and audits of a large number of platform applications and we also have announced several product changes that restrict
developer access to certain user data. In some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable  to developers have adversely
affected  or  will  adversely  affect  our  relationships  with  developers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  our  efforts  to  maintain  or  grow  the  number  of  developers  that
choose  to  build  products  that  integrate  with  Facebook  and  our  other  products  or  if  we  are  unable  to  continue  to  build  and  maintain  good  relations  with  such
developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.
Payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm
our business.
Our  users  can  purchase  virtual  and  digital  goods  from  developers  that  offer  applications  using  our  Payments  infrastructure  on  the  Facebook  website.  In
addition certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure including on Messenger for other activities such as sending money to other users and making
donations  to  certain  charitable  organizations.  We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States  Europe  and  elsewhere  including  those
governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer
charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations
including those governing gambling banking and lending. In some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To
increase  flexibility  in  how  our  use  of  Payments  may  evolve  and  to  mitigate  regulatory  uncertainty  we  have  received  certain  money  transmitter  licenses  in  the
United States and an Electronic Money E-Money license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of
the  European  Economic  Area  which  will  generally  require  us  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  many  domestic  and  foreign  laws  in  these  areas.  Our  efforts  to
comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event
that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist
order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
In addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions including: increased costs and diversion of management
time  and  effort  and  other  resources  to  deal  with  bad  transactions  or  customer  disputes;  potential  fraudulent  or  otherwise  illegal  activity  by  users  developers
employees or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We
also intend to launch certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services which may subject
us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.
Our participation in the Libra Association will subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business reputation
or financial results.
In  June  2019  we  announced  our  participation  in  the  Libra  Association  which  will  oversee  a  proposed  digital  payments  system  powered  by  blockchain
technology and our plans for Calibra a digital wallet for Libra which we expect to launch in Messenger WhatsApp and as a standalone application.
Libra is based on relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based payments are uncertain and evolving.
Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. As a primary sponsor of the
initiative we are participating in responses to
