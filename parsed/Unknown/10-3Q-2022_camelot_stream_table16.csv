Revenue acklog and Deferred Revenues,,,,,,,,,
,As  of  September  30  2022  we  had  52.4  billion  of  remaining  performance  obligations  “revenue  backlog”,,,,,,,,
primarily related to Google Cloud and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the,,,,,,,,,
next  24  months  with  the  remaining  to  be  recognized  thereafter.  Our  revenue  backlog  represents  commitments  in,,,,,,,,,
customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of,,,,,,,,,
revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability,,,,,,,,,
to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when,,,,,,,,,
we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded,,,,,,,,,
as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of,,,,,,,,,
one year or less and cancellable contracts.,,,,,,,,,
,We  record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance,,,,,,,,
including  amounts  which  are  refundable.  Deferred  revenues  primarily  relate  to  Google  Cloud  and  Google  other.,,,,,,,,,
Total deferred revenue as of December 31 2021 was 3.8 billion of which 2.4 billion was recognized as revenues,,,,,,,,,
during the nine months ended September 30 2022.,,,,,,,,,
