of 5.2 billion and 1.9 billion respectively.,,,,,,

primarily  driven  by  growth  in  revenues  subject  to TAC. The TAC  rate  decreased  from  21.8  to  21.4  from  2022  to,,,,,,
2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The,,,,,,
TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially,,,,,,
consistent from 2022 to 2023.,,,,,,

reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.,,,,,,
,The increase in other cost of revenues of 11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device,,,,,
