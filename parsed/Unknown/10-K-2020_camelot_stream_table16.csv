may  force  us  to  compete  in  different  ways  and  expend  significant  resources  in  order  to  remain  competitive.  If  our
competitors  are  more  successful  than  we  are  in  developing  compelling  products  or  in  attracting  and  retaining  users
advertisers publishers customers and content providers our operating results could be harmed.
Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and
could disrupt our current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies. The
investments that we are making across Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets reflect our ongoing efforts to
innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content
providers. Our investments in Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets span a wide range of industries beyond
online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return
of  capital  and  in  pursuing  new  strategies  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities.  These  endeavors  may  involve
significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of management resources and with respect to Other ets the
use  of  alternative  investment  governance  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to  adequately  align  incentives
across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones and home devices
which  is  a  highly  competitive  market  with  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services  rapid  adoption  of
"technological  advancements  by  competitors  short  product 
life  cycles  evolving 
industry  standards  continual"
"improvement 
in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics  and  price  and 
feature  sensitivity  on 
the  part  of"
consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services
including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to
support cloud computing services and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time our
competitors  are  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  cloud-based  services.  Pricing  and  delivery  models  are  competitive
and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.
Within  Other  ets  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health  life  sciences  and  transportation  among
others. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our
offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.
In  addition  new  and  evolving  products  and  services  including  those  that  use  artificial  intelligence  and  machine
learning  raise  ethical  technological  legal  regulatory  and  other  challenges  which  may  negatively  affect  our  brands
and demand for our products and services. ecause all of these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can
be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and
operating results.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating
margin in the future.
"Our  revenue  growth  rate  could  decline  over 
time  as  a  result  of  a  number  of 
factors 
including 
increasing"
"competition  and 
the  continued  expansion  of  our  business 
into  a  variety  of  new 
fields.  Changes 
in  device  mix"
geographic mix ongoing product and policy changes product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for
advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a  decline  in  our  revenue
growth  rate  as  our  revenues  increase  to  higher  levels  if  there  is  a  decrease  in  the  rate  of  adoption  of  our  products
services  and  technologies  or  due  to  deceleration  or  decline  in  demand  for  devices  used  to  access  our  services
among other factors. In addition COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to
adversely impact our revenue growth rate as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General
Risks’ below.
In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate we may also experience downward pressure on our operating
margin resulting from a variety of factors such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields including
products and services such as hardware Google Cloud and subscription products as well as significant investments
in Other ets all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience
downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increased costs
for many aspects of our business including within advertising where changes such as device mix property mix and
partner agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members
could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them. We may also pay increased
TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition
