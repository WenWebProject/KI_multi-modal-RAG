have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in Europe on various tax-,

proposals  relating  to  its  initiative  for  modernizing  international  tax  rules  with  the  goal  of  having  different  countries,

global spread of COVID-19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose,
