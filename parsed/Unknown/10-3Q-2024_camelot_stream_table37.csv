We  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding
penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts including
those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.
Non-Income Taxes
We  are  under  audit  by  various  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities  with  regards  to  non-income  tax  matters.
The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We
accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by  or  any  negotiated  agreements  with  these  tax
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and
the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity
and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially
different from our expectations.
See Note 13 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

Share Repurchases
In the three and nine months ended September 30 2024 we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class
C  shares  in  a  manner  deemed  in  the  best  interest  of  the  company  and  its  stockholders  taking  into  account  the
economic cost and prevailing market conditions including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and
Class C shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30 2024 we repurchased 15.3 billion and
47.0 billion respectively of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.
In April 2023 the oard of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to 70.0 billion of its
Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the

an  additional  70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C  shares. As  of  September  30  2024  59.7  billion  remained
