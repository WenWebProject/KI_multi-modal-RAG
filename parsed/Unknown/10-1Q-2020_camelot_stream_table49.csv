,Interest and other income expense net in the three months ended March 31 2020 decreased 197 million or 119 compared to the same period in 2019.,,,,,,,
The decrease was due to an increase in other expense net which was mostly related to higher foreign exchange losses compared to the same period in 2019 as a,,,,,,,,
result  of  foreign  currency  transactions  and  reâ€‘measurement.  This  decrease  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  interest  income  net  due  to  higher  investment,,,,,,,,
balances.,,,,,,,,

,Our provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2020 decreased 94 million or 9 compared to the same period in 2019 which was mostly due to a,,,,,,,
decrease in income from operations prior to the effect of the 2019 legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that is not expected to be tax-deductible.,,,,,,,,
,Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of  2020 decreased compared to the same period in  2019 mostly due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the FTC,,,,,,,
settlement that is not expected to be tax-deductible.,,,,,,,,
,On July 27 2015 the United States Tax Court issued a decision Tax Court Decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner which concluded that related parties,,,,,,,
in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner,,,,,,,,
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit. On June 7 2019 the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion that reversed the Tax,,,,,,,,
Court Decision. ased on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of 1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July,,,,,,,,
22 2019 the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12 2019. The taxpayer has requested a hearing,,,,,,,,
before the Supreme Court of the United States. As a result the final outcome of the case is uncertain. In November 2019 we made a 1.64 billion payment related,,,,,,,,
to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the related tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the Altera Ninth,,,,,,,,
Circuit Opinion is reversed we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time.,,,,,,,,
,Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for,,,,,,,
income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income tax effects from share-based compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property,,,,,,,,
from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the effects of changes in tax law.,,,,,,,,
,The  accounting  for  share-based  compensation  may  increase  or  decrease  our  effective  tax  rate  based  upon  the  difference  between  our  share-based,,,,,,,
compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price,,,,,,,,
remains constant to the April 24 2020 price we expect our effective tax rate for the full-year 2020 will be in the high-teens although we may see fluctuations in,,,,,,,,
our quarterly rate depending on our financial results.,,,,,,,,
,Integrating  intellectual  property  from  acquisitions  into  our  business  generally  involves  intercompany  transactions  that  have  the  impact  of  increasing  our,,,,,,,
provision  for  income  taxes.  Consequently  our  provision  for  income  taxes  and  our  effective  tax  rate  may  initially  increase  in  the  period  of  an  acquisition  and,,,,,,,,
integration.  The  magnitude  of  this  impact  will  depend  upon  the  specific  type  size  and  taxing  jurisdictions  of  the  intellectual  property  as  well  as  the  relative,,,,,,,,
contribution to income in subsequent periods.,,,,,,,,
,Unrecognized Tax enefits. As  of  March 31 2020  we  had  net  unrecognized  tax  benefits  of  3.95 billion which  were  accrued  as  other  liabilities.  These,,,,,,,
unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with,,,,,,,,
