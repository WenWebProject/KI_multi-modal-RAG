9.    RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.
9.1    Awards of Restricted Stock Units. A Restricted Stock Unit “RSU” is an award to an eligible Employee Consultant or
Non-Employee  Director  covering  a  number  of  Shares  that  may  be  settled  in  cash  or  by  issuance  of  those  Shares  which  may  consist  of
Restricted Stock. All RSUs shall be made pursuant to an Award Agreement.
9.2    Terms of RSUs. The Committee will determine the terms of an RSU including without limitation: a the number of
Shares subject to the RSU; b the time or times during which the RSU may be settled; c the consideration to be distributed on settlement;
and d the effect of the Participant’s Termination on each RSU. An RSU may be awarded upon satisfaction of such performance goals based
on Performance Factors during any Performance Period as are set out in advance in the Participant’s Award Agreement. If the RSU is being
earned  upon  satisfaction  of  Performance  Factors  then  the  Committee  will:  x  determine  the  nature  length  and  starting  date  of  any
Performance  Period  for  the  RSU;  y  select  from  among  the  Performance  Factors  to  be  used  to  measure  the  performance  if  any;  and
z  determine  the  number  of  Shares  deemed  subject  to  the  RSU.  Performance  Periods  may  overlap  and  participants  may  participate
simultaneously with respect to RSUs that are subject to different Performance Periods and different performance goals and other criteria.
9.3        Form  and  Timing  of  Settlement.  Payment  of  earned  RSUs  shall  be  made  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  dates
determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee in its sole discretion may settle earned RSUs in cash
Shares or a combination of both. The Committee may also permit a Participant to defer payment under a RSU to a date or dates after the
RSU is earned provided that the terms of the RSU and any deferral satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
9.4        Termination. Except as  may  be set forth in  the Participant’s Award  Agreement vesting  ceases  on such Participant’s
Termination Date unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
