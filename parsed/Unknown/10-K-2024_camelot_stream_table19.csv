It  is  hard  to  predict  the  challenges  we  may  encounter  in  adapting  our  products  and  services  and  developing
"competitive  new  products  and  services.  We  expect 
to  continue 
to  devote  significant  resources 
to  creating  and"
supporting  products  and  services  across  multiple  platforms  and  devices.  Failing  to  attract  and  retain  a  substantial
number  of  device  manufacturers  suppliers  distributors  developers  and  users  or  failing  to  develop  products  and
technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating
results and ability to capture future business opportunities.
Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.
Our  evolving  AI-related  efforts  may  give  rise  to  risks  related  to  harmful  content  inaccuracies  discrimination
"intellectual  property 
infringement  or  misappropriation  violation  of 
rights  of  publicity  defamation  data  privacy"
cybersecurity and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies our
implementation  of AI  systems  could  subject  us  to  competitive  harm  regulatory  action  legal  liability  including  under
"new  and  proposed 
legislation  and  regulations  new  applications  of  existing  data  protection  privacy 
intellectual"
property and other laws and brand or reputational harm.
Some  uses  of  AI  will  present  ethical  issues  and  may  have  broad  effects  on  society.  In  order  to  implement  AI
responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant
resources to develop test and maintain our products and services but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-
related issues deficiencies and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences uses or customization of our
AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights privacy employment or other social concerns which may
result in claims lawsuits brand or reputational harm and increased regulatory scrutiny any of which could harm our
business financial condition and operating results.
"Data  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating 
to  our 
technology  and  our  practices  could  harm  our"
reputation  cause  us  to  incur  significant  liability  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from
using our products and services. Computer viruses software bugs or defects security breaches and attacks
on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’
and customers’ ability to use our products and services harming our business and reputation.
"Concerns  about 
including 
the  adequacy  of  our  practices  with  regard 
to 
the  collection  use  governance"
disclosure  or  security  of  personal  data  or  other  data-privacy-related  matters  even  if  unfounded  could  harm  our
business  reputation  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  Our  policies  and  practices  may  change  over  time  as
expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.
Our  products  and  services  involve  the  storage  handling  and  transmission  of  proprietary  and  other  sensitive
information. Malicious software such as viruses software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products
and services as well as cyber attacks phishing schemes and other types of security breaches expose us to a risk of
loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities
including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally  our  products  incorporate  highly
technical  and  complex  technologies  and  thus  our  technologies  and  software  have  contained  and  are  likely  in  the
future to contain undetected errors bugs and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our
offerings and internal systems and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our
and the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the
past  discovered  and  may  in  the  future  discover  some  errors  in  our  software  code  only  after  we  have  released  the
code.  Systems  and  control  failures  security  breaches  failure  to  comply  with  our  privacy  policies  and/or  inadvertent
disclosure  of  user  data  could  result  in  regulatory  and  legal  exposure  seriously  harm  our  reputation  brand  and
business and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and
may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such
incidents will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security
protections that limit the effect of bugs theft misuse and security vulnerabilities or breaches.
We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.
Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods
of time. For example the development and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or
exacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents particularly where such technologies are exploited by
"third  parties 
to  breach  our  or  other  parties’  systems 
including  when  such 
technologies  are  used 
to 
target  our"
employees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We
have also seen and will continue to see industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities which could affect our or
other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to
prevent  security  incidents  and  address  undesirable  activity  on  our  platform  may  require  us  to  spend  additional
resources to prepare and defend against such threats and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition
