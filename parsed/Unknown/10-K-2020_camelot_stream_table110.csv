,While each EC decision is under appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on,,
our Consolidated alance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fines.,,,
,From  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  on  competition  matters  by,,
regulatory  authorities  in  the  United  States  Europe  and  other  jurisdictions.  For  example  in  August  2019  we  began,,,
receiving  civil,"investigative  demands 
from","the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice 
""DOJ"" 
requesting",information  and
documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of,,,
state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to,,,
Search  and  Search  advertising.  Separately  on  December  16  2020  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  filed  an,,,
antitrust  complaint  against  Google  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Texas  alleging  that,,,
Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state  deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology.  We,,,
believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General,,,
continue  their  investigations  into  certain  aspects  of  our  business.  We  continue  to  cooperate  with  federal  and  state,,,
regulators in the United States and other regulators around the world.,,,
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims,,,
,We  have  had  patent  copyright  trade  secret  and  trademark  infringement  lawsuits  filed  against  us  claiming  that,,
certain of our products services and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these,,,
lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or  orders,,,
preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have to change,,,
our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues,,,
"for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition the U.S. International Trade Commission ""ITC"" has increasingly",,,
become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result,,,
in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. ecause the U.S. is an important market a prohibition on,,,
importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into,,,
the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.,,,
,Furthermore  many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  require  us  to  indemnify  them  against,,
certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,,,
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition our,,,
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions,,,
or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.,,,
,"In  2010  Oracle  America  Inc.  ""Oracle""  brought  a  copyright  lawsuit  against  Google  in  the  Northern  District  of",,
California  alleging,that  Google's  Android  operating  system,infringes  Oracle's  copyrights  related,to  certain  Java
application  programming  interfaces.  After  trial  final  judgment  was  entered  by  the  district  court  in  favor  of  Google  on,,,
June 8 2016 and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27 2018 the,,,
appeals  court  reversed  and  remanded  the  case  for  a  trial  on  damages.  On  May  29  2018  we  filed  a  petition  for  a,,,
rehearing at the Federal Circuit and on August 28 2018 the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24 2019,,,
we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29 2019 the Supreme Court,,,
requested  the  views  of  the  Solicitor  General  regarding  our  petition.  On  September  27  2019  the  Solicitor  General,,,
recommended denying our petition and we provided our response on October 16 2019. On November 15 2019 the,,,
Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments,,,
in  our  case  on  October  7  2020.  If  the  Supreme  Court  does  not  rule  in  our  favor  the  case  will  be  remanded  to  the,,,
district court for further determination of the remaining issues in the case including damages if any. We believe this,,,
lawsuit  is  without  merit  and  are  defending  ourselves  vigorously.  Given  the  nature  of  this  case  we  are  unable  to,,,
estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any arising from this matter.,,,
