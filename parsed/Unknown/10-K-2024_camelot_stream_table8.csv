make that even easier with AI. For example advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads,

uild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices,
,Over the years our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on
top of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users,
such  as  Gemini  on  Pixel  Pixel  Screenshots  and  Pixel  Studio.  Our Android  and  Chrome  operating  systems  enable,
users to access Gemini and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example with Circle to Search built,
directly into the Android experience users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.,
Moonshots,
,Many  companies  get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done  making  only  incremental  changes.  This
incrementalism  leads  to  irrelevance  over  time  especially  in  technology  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary  not,
evolutionary.  Our  acquisitions  of  YouTube  and Android  and  subsequent  launch  of  Chrome  have  matured  into  major,
platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser. In Other ets our fully autonomous driving,
technology  company  Waymo  is  now  providing  fully  autonomous  paid  ride-hailing  services  to  customers  in  multiple,
cities.,
,Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central
to  future  developments.  We  continue  to  look  toward  the  future  and  to  invest  for  the  long  term  most  notably  for  the,
application of AI to our products and services as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As,
we said in the original founders' letter we will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects that we believe in as,
they are the key to our long-term success.,
Privacy and Security,
,We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products users and customers even if there are
near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;,
strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that,
put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time whether by enabling users to auto-delete,
their data applying privacy technologies like on-device processing giving people tools to control their experience or,
advancing anti-malware anti-phishing and password security features.,
Google,
For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.,
Google Services,
Serving Our Users,
,We  have  always  been  committed  to  building  helpful  products  that  can  improve  the  lives  of  millions  of  people
worldwide.  Our  product,"innovations  are  what  make  our  services  widely  used  and  our  brand  one  of 
the  most"
recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads Android Chrome devices Gmail,
Google Drive Google Maps Google Photos Google Play Search and YouTube with broad and growing adoption by,
users around the world.,
,Our  products  and  services  have  come  a  long  way  since  the  company  was  founded  more  than  25  years  ago.
While  Google  Search  started  as  a  way  to  find  web  pages  organized  into  ten  blue  links  we  have  driven  technical,
advancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic multimodal experience.,
We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search making it easier to navigate on smaller,
screens.  As  new  types  of  content  surfaced  on  the  internet  Universal  Search  made  it  possible  to  search  multiple,
content  types  like  news  images  videos  and  more  to  deliver  rich  relevant  results. The  introduction  of  new  search,
modalities  like  voice  and  visual  search  made  it  easier  for  people  to  express  their  curiosity  in  natural  and  intuitive,
ways. We took that a step further with multisearch which lets people search with text and images at the same time.,
Large language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries vastly improving the types of,
questions users can ask and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people,
to  find  what  they  are  looking  for.  We  are  now  using  Gemini  customized  for  Google  Search  to  provide  our  users  an,
improved Search experience and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries reaching more,
than one billion users.,
,This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery
and  creation  of  digital  content  both  on  the  web  and  through  platforms  like  Google  Play  and  YouTube.  People  are,
consuming many forms of digital content including watching videos streaming TV playing games listening to music,
