Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability,
,We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our
core  values  at  Google  and  we  strive  to  build  sustainability  into  everything  we  do.  We  have  been  a  leader  on,
sustainability and climate change since Google’s founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements,
over the past two decades:,
•,In 2007 we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.
•,In  2017  we  became  the  first  major  company  to  match  100  of  our  annual  electricity  use  with  renewable
,energy which we have achieved for four consecutive years.
•,In 2020 we issued 5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by
,any company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and
,socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency clean energy green buildings clean
,transportation circular economy and design affordable housing commitment to racial equity and support for
,small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of December 31 2020 we have allocated 3.47 billion of
,the net proceeds as outlined in our Sustainability ond Impact Report published in 2021.
•,Also in 2020 we compensated for our legacy carbon footprint making Google the first major company to be
,carbon neutral for its entire operating history.
,Our sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a
circular economy empowering everyone with technology and benefiting the people and places where we operate.,
,To  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  carbon-free  economy  in  2020  we  launched  our  third  decade  of  climate  action
and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. y 2030 we aim to:,
•,achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain;
•,become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a
,year;
•,enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and
•,help  more  than  500  cities  and  local  governments  reduce  an  aggregate  of  1  gigaton  of  carbon  emissions
,annually.
,To accelerate the transition to a circular economy we are working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across
our  operations  products  and  supply  chains  and  to  enable  others  to  do  the  same.  We  are  also  working  to  empower,
everyone  with  technology  by  committing  to  help  1  billion  people  make  more  sustainable  choices  by  the  end  of  2022,
through our core products.,
,To benefit the people and places where we operate we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume
by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We will focus on three areas: enhancing our,
stewardship  of  water  resources  across  Google  office  campuses  and  data  centers;  replenishing  our  water  use  and,
improving  watershed  health  and  ecosystems  in  water-stressed  communities;  and  sharing  technology  and  tools  that,
help everyone predict prevent and recover from water stress.,
,We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join
us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have achieved so far and we are energized to help,
move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.,
,More  information  on  our  approach  to  sustainability  can  be  found  in  our  annual  sustainability  reports  including
Google’s Environmental Report and Alphabet’s 2021 Sustainability ond Impact Report which outlines the allocation of,
our  net  proceeds  from  our  sustainability  bonds.  The  contents  of  our  sustainability  reports  are  not  incorporated  by,
