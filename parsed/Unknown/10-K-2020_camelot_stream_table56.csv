Quarterly Results of Operations,
The,"following 
tables  presenting  our  quarterly  results  of  operations  should  be  read 
in  conjunction  with 
the"
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We,
have  prepared  the  unaudited  information  on  the  same  basis  as  our  audited  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our,
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.,
The,"following 
table  presents  our  unaudited  quarterly 
results  of  operations 
for 
the  eight  quarters  ended"
December  31  2020.  This  table  includes  all  adjustments  consisting  only  of  normal  recurring  adjustments  that  we,
consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters,
presented.  Seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage  and  advertiser  expenditures  underlying  business  trends  such  as,
traditional  retail  seasonality  and  macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected  and  are  likely  to  continue  to  affect  our,
business,"including  developments  and  volatility  arising 
from  COVID-19.  Commercial  queries 
typically 
increase"
significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause,
fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.,
