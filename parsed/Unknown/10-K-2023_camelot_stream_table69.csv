Use of Estimates,,
,Preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and,
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.,,
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our,,
estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values,,
of  financial  instruments  and  goodwill;  income  taxes;  inventory;  and  useful  lives  of  property  and  equipment  among,,
others. We base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable,,
and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.,,
,In  January  2023  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and,
adjusted  the  estimated  useful  life  of  our  servers  from  four  years  to  six  years  and  the  estimated  useful  life  of  certain,,
network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal,,
year 2023. ased on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31 2022 and those,,
placed in service during the year ended December 31 2023 the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in,,
depreciation  expense  of  3.9  billion  and  an  increase  in  net  income  of  3.0  billion  or  0.24  per  basic  and  0.24  per,,
diluted share for the year ended December 31 2023.,,
Revenue Recognition,,
,Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and,
the  collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other,,
similar taxes are excluded from revenues.,,
