Indemnifications,,
,In the normal course of business including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate,
activities we indemnify certain parties including advertisers Google Network partners customers of Google Cloud,,
offerings  lessors  and  service  providers  with  respect  to  certain  matters.  We  have  agreed  to  hold  certain  parties,,
harmless  against  losses  arising  from  a  breach  of  representations  or  covenants  or  out  of  intellectual  property,,
infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which,,
an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition we have entered into indemnification,,
agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.,,
,It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification,
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally we have,,
a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not,,
had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position. However to the extent,,
that  valid  indemnification  claims  arise  in  the  future  future  payments  by  us  could  be  significant  and  could  have  a,,
material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.,,
,As  of  September  30  2022  we  did  not  have  any  material  indemnification  claims  that  were  probable  or,
reasonably possible.,,
