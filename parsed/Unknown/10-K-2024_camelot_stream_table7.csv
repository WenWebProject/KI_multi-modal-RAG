Making AI Helpful for Everyone,,,
,We  believe  AI  is  a  profound  platform  shift  one  that  can  bring  meaningful  and  positive  change  to  people  and,,
societies across the world and to our business. At Google we have been bringing AI into our products and services for,,,
more than a decade and making them available to our users.,,,
,In 2023 we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of,,
Gemini our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024 we launched Gemini 2.0 our most capable model yet. Gemini can,,,
generalize and seamlessly understand operate across and combine different types of information including text code,,,
audio  image  and  video.  Gemini  is  powering AI  features  across  our  products  and  services  that  are  helping  people,,,
everyday. Today all seven of our two billion-user products — Android Chrome Gmail Maps Play Store Search and,,,
YouTube — are using Gemini.,,,
,Our Google Cloud products including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace help organizations stay at,,
the forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure AI development platform world-class models as well as,,,
assistive agents and applications.,,,
,We believe AI has the potential to solve important societal scientific and engineering challenges. For example in,,
2020  Google  DeepMind’s  AlphaFold  system  solved  a  50-year-old  protein,,folding  challenge  and,in  2024  we
introduced AlphaFold 3 built on the previous models to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in,,,
life's processes.,,,
,We are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we,,
deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.,,,
,Deliver the Most Advanced Safe and Responsible AI,,
"We  aim 
to  build",the  most  advanced  safe  and  responsible  AI,through  a,full  stack  of  robust  AI-optimized
infrastructure including data centers chips and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global,,,
reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.,,,
,We are driving efficiencies in our data centers while making significant hardware and model improvements. For,,
example since we started serving AI Overviews to our users we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency,,,
through  hardware  engineering  and  technical  breakthroughs.  Our  AI-optimized  infrastructure  allows  us  to  use  and,,,
offer our customers a range of AI accelerator options including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units TPUs.,,,
,Our  teams  across  Alphabet  leverage  Gemini  as  well  as  other  AI  models  we  have  previously  developed  and,,
announced  to  deliver  the  best  product  and  service  experiences  for  our  users  advertisers  partners  customers  and,,,
developers.  We  are  using  Gemini  2.0  in  new  research  prototypes  including  Project Astra  which  explores  the  future,,,
capabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as,,,
an experimental extension.,,,
,We  believe  our  approach  to  AI  must  be  both  bold  and  responsible.  That  means  developing  AI  in  a  way  that,,
maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges guided by our AI Principles.,,,
,Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud,,
,AI  is  a  major  technology  shift  for  enterprises.  Globally  businesses  from  startups  to  large  enterprises  and  the,,
public  sector  are  thinking  about  how  to  drive  transformation.  That  is  why  we  are  focused  on  making  it  easy  and,,,
scalable  for  others  to  innovate  and  grow  with  AI.  That  means  providing  advanced  computing  infrastructure  and,,,
expanding  access  to  Google’s  latest  AI  models.  Our  Vertex  AI  platform  gives  developers  the  ability  to  train  tune,,,
augment test and deploy applications using Gemini Imagen Veo and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google,,,
Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write document test and operate software as,,,
well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze detect protect and respond to threats.,,,
,Improve Knowledge Learning Creativity and Productivity,,
,As AI continues to improve rapidly we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most,,
helpful  tools.  Examples  include AI  Overviews  which  allow  users  to  ask  their  most  complex  questions  break  down,,,
concepts in a format that is useful for them or take a video and ask a question out loud and NotebookLM which helps,,,
users understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the,,,
power  of  generative  AI  to  continue  helping  our  users  express  themselves  and  get  things  done.  For  example  the,,,
Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities coding support,,,
and  app  integration.  Gemini  for  Google  Workspace  helps  users  write  organize  visualize  accelerate  workflows  and,,,
have  richer  meetings.  Additionally  we  are  using  Gemini  to  improve  recommendations  on  YouTube.  We  also  know,,,
businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — and we,,,
