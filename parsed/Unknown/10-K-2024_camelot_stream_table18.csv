Alphabet Inc."
Our  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow
internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  51  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2024.  In
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the
following:
"•
restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent"
us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;
"•
sanctions  import  and  export  controls  other  market  access  barriers  political  unrest  geopolitical  tensions"
changes in regimes or armed conflict such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine any of which
may affect our business continuity increase our operating costs limit demand for our products and services
limit  our  ability  to  source  components  or  final  products  or  prevent  or  impede  us  from  operating  in  certain
jurisdictions complying with local laws or offering products or services;
"•
longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;"
"•
an  evolving  foreign  policy  landscape  that  could  harm  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  litigation  new"
regulatory  costs  and  challenges  including  new  customer  requirements  uncertainty  regarding  regulatory
outcomes and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;
"•
anti-corruption laws such as  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting certain"
payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and
"•
different  employee/employer  relationships;  different  labor  laws  regulations  and  labor  practices;  and  other"
challenges caused by distance language local expertise and cultural differences increasing the complexity
of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.
ecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars
we  have  faced  and  will  continue  to  face  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates. Although  we
hedge  a  portion  of  our  international  currency  exposure  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.
dollar  and  foreign  currencies  have  in  the  past  and  may  in  the  future  adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  earnings.
Hedging  programs  are  also  inherently  risky  and  could  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  financial
condition and operating results.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and in some instances our financial
statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.
The fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be and certain investments have been in the
past negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying
entities foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates the effect of new or changing regulations the stock market
in general or other factors.
We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities certain other instruments including stock-
based compensation awards settled in the stock of Other et companies and certain assets and liabilities acquired in
a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis which is inherently subjective and requires management
judgment  and  estimation.  All  gains  and  losses  on  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  recognized  in  OI&E  which
increases  the  volatility  of  our  OI&E.  The  unrealized  gains  and  losses  or  impairments  we  record  from  fair  value
remeasurements  in  any  particular  period  may  differ  significantly  from  the  gains  and  losses  we  ultimately  realize  on
such investments.
As a result of these factors the value of our investments could decline which could harm our financial condition
and operating results.
