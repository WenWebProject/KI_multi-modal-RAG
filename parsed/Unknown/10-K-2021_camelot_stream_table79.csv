of approximately 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion respectively. Our share of gains and losses including impairments are,,,,,

Derivative Financial Instruments,,,,,
,We  enter  into  derivative  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  our  ongoing  business  operations.  The  primary,,,,
risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk,,,,,
that  our  cash  flows  earnings  and  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries  will  be  adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency,,,,,
exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and,,,,,
enhance investment returns.,,,,,
,We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated alance Sheets at fair value,,,,
and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts an option,,,,,
strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options at net fair values where both the purchased and,,,,,
written  options  are  with  the  same  counterparty.  For  other  derivative  contracts  we  present  at  gross  fair  values.  We,,,,,
primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income expense,,,,,
net or revenues or in the Consolidated alance Sheets in AOCI as discussed below.,,,,,
,We enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions,,,,
with  the  same  counterparty.  Further  we  enter  into  collateral  security  arrangements  that  provide  for  collateral  to  be,,,,,
received  or  pledged  when  the  net  fair  value  of  certain  financial  instruments  fluctuates  from  contractually  established,,,,,
thresholds.  Cash  collateral  received  related  to  derivative  instruments  under  our  collateral  security  arrangements  are,,,,,
"included 
in  other  current  assets  with  a  corresponding",,liability.  Cash  and  non-cash  collateral  pledged  related,,,to
derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.,,,,,
Cash Flow Hedges,,,,,
,We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  including  collars  as  cash  flow  hedges  to  hedge,,,,
certain  forecasted  revenue  transactions  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  These  contracts  have,,,,,
maturities of 24 months or less.,,,,,
"Cash 
flow  hedge  amounts 
included 
in",the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred,,,,in  AOCI  and
subsequently  reclassified  to  revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  the  change  in,,,,,
forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component,,,,,
is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference,,,,,
between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If,,,,,
the  hedged  transactions  become  probable  of  not  occurring  the  corresponding  amounts  in  AOCI  are  reclassified  to,,,,,
other income expense net in the period of de-designation.,,,,,
,As of December 31 2021 the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect,,,,
was 518 million which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.,,,,,
Fair Value Hedges,,,,,
,We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our,,,,
investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the,,,,,
