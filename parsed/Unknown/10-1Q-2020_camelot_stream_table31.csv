Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements
and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31  2019  as  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.  In  addition  to  our  historical  condensed
consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs. Our actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed
"below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q particularly in Part II Item 1A ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of"
"certain of our community metrics see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
"Certain  revenue  information  in  the  section  entitled  ""—Three  Months  Ended  March  31 2020 and  2019—Revenue—Foreign  Exchange  Impact  on  Revenue""  is"
presented  on  a  constant  currency  basis.  This  information  is  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure.  To  calculate  revenue  on  a  constant  currency  basis  we  translated
revenue for the three months ended  March 31 2020 using  the prior  year's monthly  exchange  rates for  our settlement  or billing  currencies  other than  the U.S.
dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and
presented  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  This  measure  may  be  different  from  non-GAAP  financial  measures  used  by  other  companies  limiting  its  usefulness  for
comparison purposes. Moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes and investors should
be  cautioned  that  the  effect  of  changing  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  has  an  actual  effect  on  our  operating  results.  We  believe  this  non-GAAP  financial
measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between
periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management
in operating our business.
