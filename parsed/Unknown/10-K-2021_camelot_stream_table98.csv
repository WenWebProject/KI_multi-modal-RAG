,From  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  on  competition  matters  by
regulatory authorities in the U.S. Europe and other jurisdictions. In August 2019 we began receiving civil investigative,
demands  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  DOJ  requesting  information  and  documents  relating  to  our  prior,
antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a,
lawsuit on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising.,
Separately on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in,
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state,
deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22 2021 the EC opened a formal investigation into,
Google's  advertising  technology  business  practices.  On  July  7  2021  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  filed  an,
antitrust  complaint  against  us  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  alleging  that  Google’s,
operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We,
believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General,
continue  their  investigations  into  certain  aspects  of  our  business.  We  continue  to  cooperate  with  federal  and  state,
regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.,
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims,
,We  have  had  patent  copyright  trade  secret  and  trademark  infringement  lawsuits  filed  against  us  claiming  that
certain of our products services and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these,
lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or  orders,
preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have to change,
our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for,
us  and  otherwise  harm  our  business.  In  addition  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  ITC  has  increasingly,
become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result,
in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. ecause the U.S. is an important market a prohibition on,
importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into,
the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.,
,Furthermore  many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  require  us  to  indemnify  them  against
certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition our,
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions,
or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.,
,In  2010  Oracle  America  Inc.  Oracle  brought  a  copyright  lawsuit  against  Google  in  the  Northern  District  of
California  alleging,"that  Google's  Android  operating  system 
infringes  Oracle's  copyrights  related 
to  certain  Java"
application programming interfaces Java APIs. After trial final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of,
Google on June 8 2016 and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March,
27 2018 the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29,
2018 we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit and on August 28 2018 the Federal Circuit denied the,
petition. On January 24 2019 we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29 2019 the,
Supreme  Court  requested  the  views  of  the  Solicitor  General  regarding  our  petition.  On  September  27  2019  the,
Solicitor  General  recommended  denying  our  petition  and  we  provided  our  response  on  October  16  2019.  On,
November 15 2019 the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme,
Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7 2020. On April 5 2021 the Supreme Court reversed the Federal,
Circuit's  ruling  and  found  that  Google’s  use  of  the  Java  APIs  was  a  fair  use  as  a  matter  of  law.  The  Supreme  Court,
remanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May,
14 2021 the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court’s final judgment in favor of Google. On June,
21 2021 the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court and the case is now concluded.,
