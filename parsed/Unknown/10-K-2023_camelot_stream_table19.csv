social media or other platforms which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter,,,,
in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue,,,,
to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices.,,,,
Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and,,,,
users  or  failing  to  develop  products  and  technologies  that  work  well  on  new  devices  and  platforms  could  harm  our,,,,
business financial condition and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.,,,,
,Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.,,,
,Our  evolving  AI-related  efforts  may  give  rise  to  risks  related  to  harmful  content  inaccuracies  discrimination,,,
intellectual property infringement or misappropriation defamation data privacy cybersecurity and other issues. As a,,,,
result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies our implementation of AI systems could,,,,
subject  us  to  competitive  harm  regulatory  action  legal  liability  including  under  new  and  proposed  legislation  and,,,,
regulations  new  applications  of  existing  data  protection  privacy  intellectual  property  and  other  laws  and  brand  or,,,,
reputational harm.,,,,
,Some  uses  of  AI  will  present  ethical  issues  and  may  have  broad  effects  on  society.  In  order  to  implement  AI,,,
responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant,,,,
resources to develop test and maintain our products and services but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-,,,,
related issues deficiencies and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences uses or customization of our,,,,
AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights privacy employment or other social concerns which may,,,,
result in claims lawsuits brand or reputational harm and increased regulatory scrutiny any of which could harm our,,,,
business financial condition and operating results.,,,,
,Data  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating,to  our,technology  and  our  practices  could  harm  our,
reputation  cause  us  to  incur  significant  liability  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from,,,,
using our products and services. Computer viruses software bugs or defects security breaches and attacks,,,,
on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’,,,,
and customers’ ability to use our products and services harming our business and reputation.,,,,
Concerns  about,including,the  adequacy  of  our  practices  with  regard,to,the  collection  use  governance
disclosure  or  security  of  personal  data  or  other  data-privacy-related  matters  even  if  unfounded  could  harm  our,,,,
business  reputation  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  Our  policies  and  practices  may  change  over  time  as,,,,
expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.,,,,
,Our  products  and  services  involve  the  storage  handling  and  transmission  of  proprietary  and  other  sensitive,,,
information. Software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products and services and security breaches,,,,
expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other,,,,
potential  liabilities  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally  our  products,,,,
incorporate highly technical and complex technologies and thus our technologies and software have contained and,,,,
are  likely  in  the  future  to  contain  undetected  errors  bugs  and/or  vulnerabilities.  We  continue  to  add  new  features,,,,
involving AI  to  our  offerings  and  internal  systems  and  features  that  rely  on AI  may  be  susceptible  to  unanticipated,,,,
security threats as our and the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to,,,,
develop. We have in the past discovered and may in the future discover some errors in our software code only after,,,,
we have released the code. Systems and control failures security breaches failure to comply with our privacy policies,,,,
and/or,inadvertent  disclosure  of  user  data  could  result,in  government  and,,legal  exposure  seriously  harm  our
reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have,,,,
occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there,,,,
is  no  guarantee  that  such  incidents  will  not  cause  significant  damage  we  expect  to  continue  to  expend  significant,,,,
resources  to  maintain  security  protections  that  limit  the  effect  of  bugs  theft  misuse  and  security  vulnerabilities  or,,,,
breaches.,,,,
,We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.,,,
Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods,,,,
of time. We have seen and will continue to see industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities which could affect,,,,
our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our,,,,
efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition we,,,,
face  the  risk  of  cyber  attacks  by  nation-states  and  state-sponsored  actors.  These  attacks  may  target  us  or  our,,,,
customers  particularly  our  public  sector  customers  including  federal  state  and  local  governments.  Geopolitical,,,,
tensions or armed conflicts such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine may increase these risks.,,,,
,We may experience security issues whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance system errors or,,,
vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the,,,,
