Note 10. Contingencies,,,
Indemnifications,,,
,In  the  normal  course  of  business  including  to  facilitate  transactions  in  our  services  and  products  and  corporate,,
activities  we  indemnify  certain  parties  including  advertisers  Google  Network  partners  customers  of  Google  Cloud,,,
offerings  lessors  and  service  providers  with  respect  to  certain  matters.  We  have  agreed  to  hold  certain  parties,,,
harmless  against,losses  arising,from  a  breach  of  representations  or  covenants  or  out  of,intellectual  property
infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an,,,
indemnification  claim  can  be  made  and  the  amount  of  the  claim.  In  addition  we  have  entered  into  indemnification,,,
agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.,,,
,It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification,,
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally we have a,,,
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a,,,
material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position. However to the extent that valid,,,
indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse,,,
effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.,,,
,As of December 31 2021 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably,,
possible.,,,
