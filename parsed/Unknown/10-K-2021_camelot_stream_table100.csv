,If approval is obtained each of the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1 2022 the

Note 12. Net Income Per Share,
,We compute net income per share of Class A Class  and Class C stock using the two-class method. asic net
income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net,
income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  and  the  effect  of  potentially  dilutive,
securities  outstanding  during,the  period.  Potentially  dilutive  securities  consist  of  restricted  stock  units  and  other
contingently  issuable  shares.  The  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  restricted  stock  units  and  other  contingently  issuable,
shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the,
diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class  stock while the diluted net income,
per share of Class  stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.,
,The rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our Class A Class  and Class C stock
are identical except with respect to voting. Furthermore there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of,
incorporation  as  well  as  Delaware  law  which  preclude  our  oard  of  Directors  from  declaring  or  paying  unequal  per,
share dividends on our Class A Class  and Class C stock. Specifically Delaware law provides that amendments to,
our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a,
given  class  of  stock  must  be  approved  by  the  class  of  stock  adversely  affected  by  the  proposed  amendment.  In,
addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it,
must be approved by the unanimous consent of our oard of Directors. As a result the undistributed earnings for each,
year  are  allocated  based  on  the  contractual  participation  rights  of  the  Class A  Class    and  Class  C  stock  as  if  the,
earnings  for  the  year  had  been  distributed.  As  the  liquidation  and  dividend  rights  are  identical  the  undistributed,
earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.,
,In  the  years  ended  December  31  2019  2020  and  2021  the  net  income  per  share  amounts  are  the  same  for
Class A  Class    and  Class  C  stock  because  the  holders  of  each  class  are  entitled  to  equal  per  share  dividends  or,
distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.,
