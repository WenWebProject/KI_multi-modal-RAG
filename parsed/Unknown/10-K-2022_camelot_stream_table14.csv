such  as  increased  numbers  of  users  or  customers  new  sales  leads  increased  brand  awareness  or  more  effective
monetization than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well
as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past and may in the future affect
the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition technologies have been developed that make customized ads
more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated these
technologies  that  could  potentially  impair  the  availability  and  functionality  of  third-party  digital  advertising.  Failing  to
provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  business  reputation
financial condition and operating results.
"In  addition  expenditures  by  advertisers 
tend 
to 
correlate  with  overall  economic 
conditions.  Adverse"
macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected  and  may  in  the  future  affect  the  demand  for  advertising  resulting  in
fluctuations  in  the  amounts  our  advertisers  spend  on  advertising  which  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and
operating results.
We  face  intense  competition.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that
are  useful  to  users  customers  and  other  partners  we  may  not  remain  competitive  which  could  harm  our
business financial condition and operating results.
"Our  business  environment 
is 
rapidly  evolving  and 
intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses 
face  changing"
technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully
we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services
and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a
wider  range  of  products  and  services.  We  must  continue  to  invest  significant  resources  in  R&D  including  through
acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.
"We  have  many  competitors 
in  different 
industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and 
international"
competitors  range  from  large  and  established  companies  to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have  longer
operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources
in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in R&D
and  in  talent  initiating  intellectual  property  and  competition  claims  whether  or  not  meritorious  and  continuing  to
compete  for  users  advertisers  customers  and  content  providers.  Further  discrepancies  in  enforcement  of  existing
laws  may  enable  our  lesser  known  competitors  to  aggressively  interpret  those  laws  without  commensurate  scrutiny
thereby affording them competitive advantages.  Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products
and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.
Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the
evolving  needs  and  desires  of  our  users  advertisers  publishers  customers  and  content  providers.  As  new  and
existing technologies continue to develop competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are or
that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products
and services and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal
or  better  products  and  services.  Competitors’  success  in  providing  compelling  products  and  services  or  in  attracting
and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers could harm our financial condition and
operating results.
Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and
could divert management attention and harm our business financial condition and operating results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies. The
investments  that  we  are  making  across  our  businesses  such  as  in  AI  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to  innovate  and
provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers. Our
investments  span  a  wide  range  of  industries  beyond  online  advertising.  Such  investments  ultimately  may  not  be
commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategies we may incur
"unanticipated 
liabilities.  These  endeavors  may 
involve  significant  risks  and  uncertainties 
including  diversion  of"
resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and  the  use  of  alternative  investment  governance  or
compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their
objectives.
Within  Google  Services  we  continue  to  invest  heavily  in  hardware  including  our  smartphones  home  devices
and  wearables  which  is  a  highly  competitive  market  with  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services  rapid
"adoption  of 
technological  advancements  by  competitors  short  product

industry  standards"
continual improvement in performance characteristics and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and
businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
