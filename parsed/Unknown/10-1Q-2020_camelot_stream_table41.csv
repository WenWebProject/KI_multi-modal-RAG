â€¢,Monthly Active People MAP. We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least
,one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We
,do  not  require  people  to  use  a  common  identifier  or  link  their  accounts  to  use  multiple  products  in  our  Family  and  therefore  must  seek  to  attribute
,multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine
,learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts
,within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as
,one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts
,and are  calibrated  against  user survey data there  is necessarily  some margin  of error in our estimates.  We view MAP as a measure  of the size  of our
,"global active community of people using our products. For additional information see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in"
,this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
