,The  fair  value  hierarchy  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.,
,Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents
marketable securities derivative financial instruments and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets,
measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  include  non-marketable  equity  securities.  Other  financial  assets  and,
liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required.,
,We measure certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain
Other ets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination also at fair value on a nonrecurring,
basis.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate  valuation  methods  and  relevant  inputs  into,
valuation models.,
Financial Instruments,
,Our  financial  instruments  include  cash  cash  equivalents  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities  derivative
financial instruments and accounts receivable.,
Credit Risks,
,We  are  subject  to  credit  risk  from  cash  equivalents  marketable  securities  derivative  financial  instruments
including  foreign  exchange  contracts  and  accounts  receivable.  We  manage  our  credit  risk  exposure  through  timely,
assessment  of  our  counterparty  creditworthiness  credit  limits  and  use  of  collateral  management.  Foreign  exchange,
contracts  are  transacted  with  various  financial  institutions  with  high  credit  standing.  Accounts  receivable  are  typically,
unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk,
exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend.,
We generally do not require collateral from our customers.,
Cash Equivalents,
,We  invest  excess  cash  primarily  in  government  bonds  corporate  debt  securities  mortgage-backed  and  asset-
backed securities time deposits and money market funds.,
Marketable Securities,
,We  classify  all  marketable  debt  securities  that  have  stated  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  from  the  date  of
purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities,
on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets.  We  determine  the  appropriate  classification  of  our  investments  in  marketable,
debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified,
and  accounted  for  our  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  After  consideration  of  our  risk  versus  reward,
objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities. As we,
view  these  securities  as  available  to  support  current  operations  we  classify  highly  liquid  securities  with  maturities,
beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated alance Sheets. We,
carry  these  securities  at  fair  value  and  report  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  net  of  taxes  as  a  component  of,
stockholdersâ€™  equity  except  for  the  changes  in  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses  which  are  recorded  in  other,
income expense net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes,
in  fair  value  are  recorded  in  other  income  expense  net.  We  determine  any  realized  gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  of,
marketable debt securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of,
other income expense net.,
,Our  investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  related  gains  and  losses
including unrealized recognized in other income expense net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to,
long-term lock-up restrictions beyond twelve months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated alance Sheets.,
Non-Marketable Securities,
,We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have
control over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the,
equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative the,
carrying  value  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  impairment  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price,
changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer.  Adjustments  are  determined,
primarily  based  on  a  market  approach  as  of  the  transaction  date  and  are  recorded  as  a  component  of  other  income,
expense net.,
