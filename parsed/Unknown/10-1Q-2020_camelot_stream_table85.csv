As  this  initiative  evolves  we  may  be  subject  to  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States  and  international  jurisdictions  including  those
governing payments financial services anti-money laundering counter-terrorism  financing economic sanctions data protection tax and competition. In many
