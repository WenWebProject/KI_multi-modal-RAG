â€¢,"European  Digital  Markets  Act: 
In  March  2024 
the  EC  opened 
two","investigations 
regarding  Google's"
,compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. Given the,
,preliminary stages of this matter we cannot estimate a possible loss.,
,In  addition  to  these  proceedings  private  individual  and  collective  actions  that  overlap  with  claims  pursued  by,
regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions.,,
,We  believe  we  have  strong  arguments  against  these  open  claims  and  will  defend  ourselves  vigorously.  We,
continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.,,
Privacy Matters,,
,We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations and we currently are party to a number of,
privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example there are ongoing investigations and,,
litigation  in  the  U.S.  and  the  EU  including  those  relating  to  our  collection  and  use  of  location  information  alleged,,
violations  of  state  biometric  statutes  the  choices  we  offer  users  and  advertising  practices  which  could  result  in,,
significant fines judgments and product changes.,,
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims,,
,We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that,
certain of our products services and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these,,
lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or  orders,,
preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have to change,,
our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for,,
us  and  otherwise  harm  our  business.  In  addition  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  ITC  has  increasingly,,
become  an  important  forum  to  litigate  intellectual  property  disputes  because  an  ultimate  loss  in  an  ITC  action  can,,
result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing  infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  ecause  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market  a,,
prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important,,
products  into  the  U.S.  or  necessitating  workarounds  that  may  limit  certain  features  of  our  products.  Further  our,,
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions,,
or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.,,
Other,,
,We  are  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  inquiries  and  investigations  other  proceedings,
and consent orders involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security tax and related compliance,,
labor  and  employment  commercial  disputes  content  generated  by  our  users  goods  and  services  offered  by,,
advertisers  or  publishers  using  our  platforms  personal  injury  consumer  protection  and  other  matters.  For  example,,
we  periodically  have  data  incidents  that  we  report  to  relevant  regulators  as  required  by  law.  Such  claims  consent,,
orders lawsuits regulatory and government investigations and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and,,
penalties,injunctive  relief  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  obligations  changes,to  our  products  and  services
alterations to our business models and operations and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences,,
all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,
,We  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example  some  matters  concern  civil  judgments  that,
include  compounding  penalties  imposed  upon  us  in  connection  with  disputes  regarding  the  termination  of  accounts,,
including  those  of  sanctioned  parties.  We  do  not  expect  these  ongoing  legal  matters  will  have  a  material  adverse,,
effect.,,
Non-Income Taxes,,
,We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The,
subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the,,
sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue,,
non-income taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when,,
a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of,,
loss  can  be  estimated  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and  uncertainty  of,,
these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially  different  from  our,,
expectations.,,
