Our ylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for
election as directors other than nominations made by or at the direction of our oard of Directors or a committee of our oard o
Directors. The ylaws do not give our oard of Directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of
candidates or proposals regarding business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. However our
ylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed.
These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirerâ€™
own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
