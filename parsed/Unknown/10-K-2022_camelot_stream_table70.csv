liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based,
on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:,
,Level  1  -  Observable  inputs  that  reflect  quoted  prices  unadjusted  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  active
markets.,
,Level  2  -  Inputs  that  are  based  upon  quoted  prices  for  similar  instruments  in  active  markets  quoted  prices  for
,identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all
,significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable
,these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based
observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings.,
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.,
,The  fair  value  hierarchy  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of
unobservable  inputs  when  measuring  fair  value.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate,
valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.,
,Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents
marketable securities derivative financial instruments and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets,
measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  include  non-marketable  equity  securities.  Other  financial  assets  and,
liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required.,
,We measure certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain
Other ets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination also at fair value on a nonrecurring,
basis.,
