growth  in  revenues  subject  to TAC. The TAC  rate  decreased  from  21.7  to  21.2  from  the  three  months  ended,,,,
September 30 2022 to the three months ended September 30 2023 and decreased from 21.8 to 21.4 from the,,,,

mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &,,,,
other  revenues  and  the TAC  rate  on  Google  Network  revenues  were  both  substantially  consistent  from  the  three,,,,

addition  an  overall  increase  in  data  center  and  other  operations  costs  was  partially  offset  by  a  reduction  in,,,,
depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.,,,,
