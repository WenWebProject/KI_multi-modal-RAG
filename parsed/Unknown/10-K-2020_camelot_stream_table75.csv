NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August
"2003. In 2015 we implemented a holding company reorganization and as a result Alphabet Inc. ""Alphabet"" became"
the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues by delivering relevant cost-effective online advertising cloud-based solutions that provide
customers with platforms collaboration tools and services and sales of other products and services such as apps and
in-app purchases digital content and subscriptions for digital content and hardware.
asis of Consolidation
The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Alphabet  include  the  accounts  of  Alphabet  and  entities  consolidated
under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
"United States ""GAAP"" requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed"
in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On
an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses fair values of
"financial 
instruments  including  non-marketable  equity  securities 
intangible  assets  and  goodwill  useful 
lives  of"
intangible  assets  and  property  and  equipment  income  taxes  and  contingent  liabilities  among  others.  We  base  our
estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
As of December 31 2020 the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold and the extent of the impact will depend on
a  number  of  factors  including  the  duration  and  severity  of  the  pandemic;  the  uneven  impact  to  certain  industries;
advances in testing treatment and prevention; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the
spread of the virus and related government stimulus measures. As a result certain of our estimates and assumptions
including  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  accounts  receivable  the  credit  worthiness  of  customers  entering  into
revenue  arrangements  the  valuation  of  non-marketable  equity  securities  including  our  impairment  assessment  and
the  fair  values  of  our  financial  instruments  require  increased  judgment  and  carry  a  higher  degree  of  variability  and
volatility that could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods.
In  January  2021  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment  and
determined we should adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated
useful  life  of  certain  network  equipment  from  three  years  to  five  years.  This  change  in  accounting  estimate  will  be
effective beginning fiscal year 2021.
