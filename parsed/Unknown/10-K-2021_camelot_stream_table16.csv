"Our  products  and  services  have  had  and 
in 
the 
future  may  have  quality 
issues 
resulting 
from  design"
manufacturing  or  operations.  Sometimes  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other
manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or
services are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results.
We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies
"such  as 
the  Google  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  regarding  workplace  and  employment  practices  data  security"
environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices. Violations
"of 
law  or  unethical  business  practices  could 
result 
in  supply  chain  disruptions  canceled  orders  harm 
to  key"
relationships  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  Their  failure  to  procure  necessary  license  rights  to  intellectual  property
could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.
Interruption to interference with or failure of our complex information technology and communications
systems  could  hurt  our  ability  to  effectively  provide  our  products  and  services  which  could  harm  our
reputation financial condition and operating results. In addition problems with the design or implementation
of our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations.
The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing
"operation  of  our 
information 
technology  and  communications  systems.  Our  systems  are  vulnerable 
to  damage"
interference or interruption from modifications or upgrades terrorist attacks natural disasters or pandemics the effects
of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and
power  shutoffs  associated  with  wildfire  prevention  and  increased  storm  severity  power  loss  telecommunications
failures  computer  viruses  ransomware  attacks  computer  denial  of  service  attacks  phishing  schemes  or  other
attempts  to  harm  or  access  our  systems.  Some  of  our  data  centers  are  located  in  areas  with  a  high  risk  of  major
earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins sabotage and intentional acts of
vandalism and in some cases to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators. Some
of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  disaster  recovery  planning  cannot  account  for  all  eventualities.  The
occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems affecting our data
centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition our products and services are highly technical
and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future errors or vulnerabilities which could result
in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.
In addition we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize
operating  results.  We  are  in  the  process  of  a  multi-year  implementation  of  a  new  ERP  system  which  is  designed  to
accurately  maintain  our  financial  records  enhance  the  flow  of  financial  information  improve  data  management  and
provide  timely  information  to  our  management  team.  As  the  phased  implementation  continues  we  may  experience
delays  increased  costs  and  other  difficulties.  Failure  to  successfully  design  and  implement  the  ERP  system  as
planned  could  harm  our  business  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  Additionally  if  we  do  not  effectively
implement  the  ERP  system  as  planned  or  the  ERP  system  does  not  operate  as  intended  the  effectiveness  of  our
internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.
Our  international  operations  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  business  our  financial
condition and operating results.
Our  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow
internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  54  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2021.  In
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the
following:
