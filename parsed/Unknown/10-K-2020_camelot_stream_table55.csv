Other income expense net,,,5394,,,6858.0
,Other income expense net increased 1464 million from 2019 to 2020. The change was primarily driven by an,,,,,
increase in net gains on equity and debt securities of 3519 million partially offset by a 902 million loss resulting from,,,,,,
our equity derivatives which hedged the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities and a decrease,,,,,,
in interest income of 562 million.,,,,,,
,Over  time  other  income  expense  net  may  be  affected  by  market  dynamics  and  other  factors.  Equity  values,,,,,
generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon,,,,,,
impairment  of  non-marketable  equity  securities.  In  addition  volatility  in  the  global  economic  climate  and  financial,,,,,,
markets  including  the  effects  of  COVID-19  could  result  in  a  significant  change  in  the  value  of  our  investments.,,,,,,
Fluctuations  in  the  value  of  these  investments  has  and  we  expect  will  continue  to  contribute  to  volatility  of  OI&E  in,,,,,,
future periods. For additional information about our investments see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated,,,,,,
Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,,,,,,
