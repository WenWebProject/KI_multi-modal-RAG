differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination,
is made.,
,The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the
related net interest and penalties. In addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns,
by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of,
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for,
income taxes.,
Loss Contingencies,
,We  are  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  inquiries  and  investigations  other  proceedings
and consent orders involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security tax and related compliance,
labor  and  employment  commercial  disputes  content  generated  by  our  users  goods  and  services  offered  by,
advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters. Certain of these,
matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we,
believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine,
that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in Note,
10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
,We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that
"has  been  previously  accrued  and 
the  matters  and 
related 
reasonably  possible",losses  disclosed  and  make
adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the,
estimated  amount  of  a  loss  related  to  such  matters.  Until  the  final  resolution  of  such  matters  there  may  be  an,
exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material.,

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES AOUT MARKET RISK",
,We  are  exposed  to  financial  market  risks  including  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  interest  rates
and equity investment risks.,
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,
,We  transact  business  globally  in  multiple  currencies.  International  revenues  as  well  as  costs  and  expenses
denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the,
"U.S.  dollar.  As  discussed  below  we  enter 
into  derivative 
instruments 
to  hedge",foreign  currency  risk.  Principal
currencies  hedged  included  the Australian  dollar  ritish  pound  Canadian  dollar  Euro  and  Japanese  yen.  For  the,
purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange,
rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in  exchange  rates  of  10  could  be,
experienced.,
,We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and
liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  subsidiary.  These  forward  and  option,
contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets,
and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E which are,
offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.,
,If  an  adverse  10  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  net  monetary  assets  liabilities  and
commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have,
resulted  in  an  adverse  effect  on  income  before  income  taxes  of  approximately  503  million  and  135  million  as  of,
December 31 2023 and 2024 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for,
the years ended December 31 2023 and 2024.,
,We  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  including  collars  an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a
combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  When  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens  gains  from  foreign  currency  forward  and  option,
contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens losses from foreign,
currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These  hedging,
contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate,
these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot,
rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassify them,
into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.,
,If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2023 and 2024 the amount recorded in AOCI related to
our  cash  flow  hedges  before  tax  effect  would  have  been  approximately  1.5  billion  and  1.6  billion  lower  as  of,
