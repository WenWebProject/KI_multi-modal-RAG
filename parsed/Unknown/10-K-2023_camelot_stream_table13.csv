,As  of  December  31  2023 Alphabet  had  182502  employees.  We  have  work  councils  and  statutory  employee,,,
representation obligations in certain countries and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights maintaining,,,,
an open culture and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work and,,,,
we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.,,,,
,When necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not,,,
have appropriate in-house expertise or resources often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations,,,,
content moderation customer support and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when,,,,
we  need  to  cover  short-term  leaves  when  we  have  spikes  in  business  needs  or  when  we  need  to  quickly  incubate,,,,
special  projects.  We  choose  our  partners  and  staffing  agencies  carefully  and  review  their  compliance  with  Google’s,,,,
Supplier  Code  of  Conduct.  We  continually  make,,improvements,to  promote  a,respectful  and  positive  working
environment for everyone — employees vendors and temporary staff alike.,,,,
Government Regulation,,,,
,We are subject to numerous United States U.S. federal state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations,,,
covering a wide variety of subjects and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and,,,,
regulatory  developments  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  Like  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry  we  face,,,,
increasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and,,,,
regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope as interpreted by the,,,,
courts  remain  uncertain.  Particularly  with  regard  to  AI;  climate  change  and  sustainability;  competition;  consumer,,,,
protection;  content  moderation;  data  privacy  and  security;  news  publications;  and  reporting  on  human  capital  and,,,,
diversity we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations as well as related enforcement actions,,,,
and investigations being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the,,,,
world.,,,,
,Our  compliance  with  these  laws  and  regulations  may  be  onerous  and  could  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,,,
increase  our  cost  of  doing  business  make  our  products  and  services  less  useful  limit  our  ability  to  pursue  certain,,,,
business models cause us to change our business practices affect our competitive position relative to our peers and/,,,,
or otherwise harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,
