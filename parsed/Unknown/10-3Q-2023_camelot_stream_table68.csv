September 30 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are,
effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  we  are  required  to  disclose  in  reports  that  we  file  or,
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified,
in  the  SECâ€™s  rules  and  forms  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,
including  our  chief  executive  officer  and  chief  financial  officer  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding,
required disclosure.,
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
,There  have  been  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  quarter
ended  September  30  2023  that  have  materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  our  internal,
control over financial reporting.,
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures,
,In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls
and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving,
the desired control objectives. In addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that,
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of,
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.,
