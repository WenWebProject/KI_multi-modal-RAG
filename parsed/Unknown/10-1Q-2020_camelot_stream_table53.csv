Contingencies
We are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a provision for a liability when we
believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility
that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated
financial  statements  to  the  extent  material.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  probability  and  the  estimated  amount  of  loss.  Such  matters  are
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or
prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows.
See Note 10 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in
"Part I Item 1 and ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part II Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding contingencies."
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  The  preparation  of  these  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  liabilities  revenue  costs  and  expenses  and  related
disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other
sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain
at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially
impact the financial statements.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2019 we disclosed the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes
loss contingencies and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential
impact on our consolidated financial statements. In addition during the quarter ended March 31 2020 in response to the economic slowdown caused by COVID-
19 pandemic we now believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable may
also  have  a  material  impact  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  future  periods  depending  on  the  duration  or  degree  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic on the global economy.
