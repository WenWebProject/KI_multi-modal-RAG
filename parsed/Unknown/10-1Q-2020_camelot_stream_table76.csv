negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the attention of management from our business or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect,,
our business.,,
Compliance with our FTC consent order the GDPR the CCPA and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements will require significant operational,,
resources  and  modifications  to  our  business  practices  and  any  compliance  failures  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business  reputation  and,,
financial results.,,
,We are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts including as a result of our modified consent order with the FTC as well as our efforts,
to comply with the GDPR and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world including the CCPA. In particular we have agreed with the FTC to,,
implement  a  comprehensive  expansion  of  our  privacy  program,including  substantial  management  and  board  of  directors  oversight,stringent  operational
requirements  and  reporting  obligations  and  a  process  to  regularly  certify  our  compliance  with  the  privacy  program  to  the  FTC  which  will  be  challenging  and,,
costly to implement. We expect that these enhancements will result in both improved privacy compliance and oversight and the discovery of additional privacy,,
issues at least in the near-term and we expect to continue to notify the FTC of such issues from time to time in accordance with our reporting obligations under,,
the consent order. These compliance and oversight efforts will increase demand on our systems and resources and will require significant investments including,,
investments in compliance processes personnel and technical infrastructure. In the near-term we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts,,
and this has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition these efforts will require substantial modifications to,,
our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult time-consuming and costly. As a result we believe our ability,,
to develop and launch new features products and services in a timely manner will be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight,,
efforts  will  require  significant  time  and  attention  from  our  management  and  board  of  directors.  In  addition  regulatory  and  legislative  privacy  requirements  are,,
constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates,,
of  the  FTC  consent  order  GDPR  CCPA  or  other  regulatory  or  legislative  requirements  or  if  we  are  found  to  be  in  violation  of  the  consent  order  or  other,,
requirements  we  may  be  subject  to  regulatory  or  governmental  investigations  or  lawsuits  which  may  result  in  significant  monetary  fines  judgments  or  other,,
penalties  and  we  may  also  be  required  to  make  additional  changes  to  our  business  practices.  Any  of  these  events  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our,,
business reputation and financial results.,,
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely,,
affected.,,
,We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third,
parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights.,,
In the United States and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a,,
significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third,,
parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark,,
and patent applications may not be approved. In addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or,,
intend  to  operate  our  business.  In  any  or  all  of  these  cases  we  may  be  required  to  expend  significant  time  and  expense  in  order  to  prevent  infringement  or  to,,
enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or,,
concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses,,
and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products. For example we have,,
contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the Open Compute Project Foundation a non-profit entity that shares and,,
develops such information with the technology community under the Open Web Foundation License. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of,,
open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also,,
be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the,,
value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of,,
operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.,,
