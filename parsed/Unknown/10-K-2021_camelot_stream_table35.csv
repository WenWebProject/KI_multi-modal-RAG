Alphabet Inc."
International  revenues  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  While  we  have  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program
designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues
and earnings.

The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely"
affect margins.
Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our
"offerings 
through  products  and  services 
like  Google  Cloud  Google  Play  hardware  products  and  YouTube"
subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases digital
content products and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud services and
subscription and other services. A number of Other ets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such
revenues  from  these  businesses  could  be  volatile.  In  addition  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and
may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues.
"•
As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and"
capital expenditures.
We  continue  to  make  significant  R&D  investments  in  areas  of  strategic  focus  across  Google  Services  Google
Cloud  and  Other  ets.  We  also  expect  to  continue  to  invest  in  land  and  buildings  for  data  centers  and  offices  and
information technology assets which includes servers and network equipment to support the long-term growth of our
business.  In  addition  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments  contribute  to  the  breadth  and  depth  of  our  offerings
"expand  our  expertise 
in  engineering  and  other 
functional  areas  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic"
initiatives. For example in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit Inc. for 2.1 billion which is expected to
help spur innovation in wearable devices.
"•
We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions laws and public policies which could affect our"
business practices and financial results.
Changes  in  social  political  economic  tax  and  regulatory  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  a  wide
range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As
these  global  trends  continue  our  cost  of  doing  business  may  increase  and  our  ability  to  pursue  certain  business
models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S.
Department  of  Justice  and  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  the  Digital  Markets  Act  in  Europe  and  various
legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.
"•
Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them."
Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring
talented  employees  around  the  globe  and  to  provide  competitive  compensation  programs.  For  additional  information
