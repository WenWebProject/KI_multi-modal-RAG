observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.
The  fair  value  hierarchy  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of
unobservable  inputs  when  measuring  fair  value.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate
valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.
Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents
marketable securities derivative financial instruments and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets
measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  include  non-marketable  equity  securities.  Other  financial  assets  and
liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required.
We measure certain other instruments and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination also
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Financial Instruments
Our  financial  instruments  include  cash  cash  equivalents  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities  derivative
financial instruments accounts receivable and convertible notes.
Credit Risks
We  are  subject  to  credit  risk  primarily  from  cash  equivalents  marketable  debt  securities  derivative  financial
instruments including foreign exchange contracts accounts receivable and convertible notes. We manage our credit
risk  exposure  through  timely  assessment  of  our  counterparty  creditworthiness  credit  limits  and  use  of  collateral
management.  Foreign  exchange  contracts  are  transacted  with  various  financial  institutions  with  high  credit  standing.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the
world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we
limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
Cash Equivalents
We  invest  excess  cash  primarily  in  asset-backed  and  mortgage-backed  securities  corporate  debt  securities
government bonds money market funds and time deposits.
Marketable Securities
We classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of
purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities
on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets.  We  determine  the  appropriate  classification  of  our  investments  in  marketable
debt  securities  at  the  time  of  purchase  and  reevaluate  such  designation  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  We  have
classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus
reward  objectives  as  well  as  our  liquidity  requirements  we  may  sell  these  debt  securities  prior  to  their  effective
maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities
with  maturities  beyond  12  months  as  current  assets  under  the  caption  marketable  securities  on  the  Consolidated
alance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a
component of stockholdersâ€™ equity except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses which are recorded
in OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value
are  recorded  in  OI&E.  We  determine  any  realized  gains  and  losses  on  the  sale  of  marketable  debt  securities  on  a
specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.
Our  investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  related  gains  and  losses
including  unrealized  recognized  in  OI&E.  We  classify  our  marketable  equity  securities  subject  to  long-term  lock-up
restrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated alance Sheets.
Non-Marketable Securities
Non-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities
through  which  we  exercise  significant  influence  but  do  not  have  control  over  the  investee  under  the  equity  method.
Other  non-marketable  equity  securities  that  we  hold  are  primarily  accounted  for  under  the  measurement  alternative.
Under  the  measurement  alternative  the  carrying  value  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  impairment  plus  or  minus
changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the
same  issuer. Adjustments  are  determined  primarily  based  on  a  market  approach  as  of  the  transaction  date  and  are
recorded as a component of OI&E.
