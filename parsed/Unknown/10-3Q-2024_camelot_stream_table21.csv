for investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances deferred origination costs,,,,
and any related discount or premium net of allowances for credit losses and are included within other non-current,,,,
assets on our Consolidated alance Sheets.,,,,
Derivative Financial Instruments,,,,
,We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk,,,
managed  is  foreign  exchange  risk.  We  use  foreign  currency  contracts  to  reduce  the  risk  that  our  cash  flows,,,,
earnings  and  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries  will  be  adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency  exchange  rate,,,,
fluctuations.  We  also  enter  into  derivative  instruments  to  partially  offset  our  exposure  to  other  risks  and  enhance,,,,
investment returns.,,,,
We  recognize  derivative,instruments,in,the  Consolidated  alance  Sheets  at,"fair  value  and  classify 
the"
derivatives  primarily  within  Level  2  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  We  present  our  collar  contracts  an  option  strategy,,,,
comprised of a combination of purchased and written options at net fair values and present all other derivatives at,,,,
gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.,,,,
Cash Flow Hedges,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts including collars as cash flow hedges to hedge,,,
certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States U.S. dollar. These,,,,
contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.,,,,
,Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and,,,
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points,,,,
and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life,,,,
of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and,,,,
the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.,,,,
,As  of  September  30  2024  the  net  accumulated  loss  on  our  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges  before  tax,,,
effect was 433 million which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.,,,,
Fair Value Hedges,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our,,,
marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in,,,,
the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in  OI&E  along  with  the  offsetting  gains  and  losses  of  the,,,,
related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and  recognize,,,,
changes in the excluded  component in OI&E.,,,,
Net Investment Hedges,,,,
,We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks,,,
related  to  our  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  Net  investment  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of,,,,
hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in AOCI  along  with  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment.  We  exclude,,,,
forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in,,,,
OI&E.,,,,
Other Derivatives,,,,
,We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to,,,
hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the,,,,
functional  currency  of  a  subsidiary.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  derivatives  that  are  not  designated  as  accounting,,,,
hedges  are  primarily  recorded  in  OI&E  along  with  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  on  monetary  assets  and,,,,
liabilities.,,,,
