LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA
The  numbers  for  our  key  metrics  are  calculated  using  internal  company  data  based  on  the  activity  of  user  accounts.  We  have  historically  reported  the
"numbers of our daily active users DAUs monthly active users MAUs and average revenue per user ARPU collectively our ""Facebook metrics"" based on"
user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on our other products. eginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31
2019  we  also  report  our  estimates  of  the  numbers  of  our  daily  active  people  DAP  monthly  active  people  MAP  and  average  revenue  per  person  ARPP
"collectively our ""Family metrics"" based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp collectively our"
"""Family"" of products during the applicable period of measurement. We believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many"
people are using more than one of our products. As a result over time we intend to report our Family metrics as our key metrics in place of DAUs MAUs and
ARPU in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent
challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure  these metrics
require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our
user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics
and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical
metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for
such  adjustments.  We  generally  do  not  intend  to  update  previously  disclosed  Family  metrics  for  any  such  inaccuracies  or  adjustments  that  are  within  the  error
margins disclosed below.
