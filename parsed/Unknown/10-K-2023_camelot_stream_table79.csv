Income Taxes,
,We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes
payable  or  refundable  for  the  current  year  and  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  future  tax  consequences  of,
events  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  financial  statements  or  tax  returns.  We  measure  current  and  deferred  tax,
assets  and  liabilities  based  on  provisions  of  enacted  tax  law.  We  evaluate  the  likelihood  of  future  realization  of  our,
deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets,
when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax,
assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the,
global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.,
,We  recognize  the  financial  statement  effects  of  a  tax  position  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  based  on
technical  merits  the  position  will  be  sustained  upon  examination.  The  tax  benefits  of  the  position  recognized  in  the,
financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be,
"realized  upon  settlement  with  a 
taxing  authority. 
In  addition  we 
recognize","interest  and  penalties 
related 
to"
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.,
usiness Combinations,
,We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the
purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,
except for revenue contracts acquired which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The,
"excess  of 
the  purchase  price  over 
the 
fair  values  of 
identifiable  assets  and","liabilities 
is  recorded  as  goodwill."
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.,
Foreign Currency,
,We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange
rates  for  assets  and  liabilities  and  average  rates  for  the  annual  period  derived  from  month-end  exchange  rates  for,
revenues  costs  and  expenses.  We  record  translation  gains  and  losses  in  AOCI  as  a  component  of  stockholdersâ€™,
equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction,
currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain loss in OI&E.,
