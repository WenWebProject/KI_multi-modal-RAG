,General Risks
,The continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant and may have an
adverse effect on our business operations and our future financial performance.,
,"Since  COVID-19  was  declared  a  global  pandemic  by 
the  World  Health  Organization  governments  and"
municipalities  around  the  world  have  instituted  measures  in  an  effort  to  control  the  spread  of  COVID-19  including,
quarantines shelter-in-place orders school closings travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses. The,
macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to evolve and be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect,
our business operations and financial performance. As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at,
which  the  global  community  has  been  impacted  our  revenue  growth  rate  and  expense  as  a  percentage  of  our,
revenues  in  future  periods  may  differ  significantly  from  our  historical  rate  and  our  future  operating  results  may  fall,
below expectations.,
,The future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business operations and future financial performance could
include but are not limited to:,
,"•
Significant  decline  in  advertising  revenues  as  advertiser  spending  slows  due  to  an  economic  downturn.  This"
,decline in advertising revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period. In addition we may
,experience  a  significant  and  prolonged  shift  in  user  behavior  such  as  a  shift  in  interests  to  less  commercial
,topics.
•,Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand. For example if consumer
,demand for electronics significantly declines our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted.
•,Adverse  impacts  to  our  operating  income  operating  margin  net  income  EPS  and  respective  growth  rates  -
,particularly if expenses do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines. Many of our
,"expenses  are 
less  variable 
in  nature  and/or  may  not  correlate 
to  changes 
in  revenues 
including  costs"
,associated  with  our  data  centers  and  facilities  as  well  as  employee  compensation.  As  such  we  may  not  be
,able to decrease them significantly in the short-term or we may choose not to significantly reduce them in an
,effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and investment opportunities.
•,Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and deterioration in
,the credit quality and liquidity of our customers which could adversely affect our accounts receivable. Investing
,cash  flows  could  decrease  due  to  slowing  spend  on  data  center  and  facilities  construction  projects  due  to  a
,slowing or stopping of construction or significant restrictions placed on construction.
•,"The  prolonged  and  broad-based  shift 
to  a 
remote  working  environment  continues 
to  create 
inherent"
,productivity connectivity and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance develop and support
,existing  products  and  services  detect  and  prevent  spam  and  problematic  content  hold  product  sales  and
,marketing events and generate new sales leads among others. In addition the changed environment under
,which  we  are  operating  could  have  an  effect  on  our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  as  well  as  our
,ability  to  meet  a  number  of  our  compliance  requirements  in  a  timely  or  quality  manner.  Additional  and/or
,extended governmental lockdowns restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our
,employees and vendors to work productively. Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it
,remains  unclear  when  a  return  to  worksite  locations  or  travel  will  be  permitted  or  what  restrictions  will  be  in
,place  in  those  environments.  As  we  prepare  to  return  our  workforce  in  more  locations  back  to  the  office  in
,2021  we  may  experience  increased  costs  as  we  prepare  our  facilities  for  a  safe  return  to  work  environment
,and experiment with hybrid work models in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete effectively and
,maintain our corporate culture.
,Our  operating  results  may  fluctuate  which  makes  our  results  difficult  to  predict  and  could  cause  our
results to fall short of expectations.,
,Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control.
,As  a  result  comparing  our  operating  results  including  our  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  our  revenues  on  a
period-to-period basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future,
performance. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our,
stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed under this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our,
operating results:,
,"•
Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of and generate significant revenues from new products"
,services and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.
