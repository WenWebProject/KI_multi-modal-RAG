Item 1.,Legal Proceedings
,eginning on March 20 2018 multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere
against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws breach of fiduciary duties and other causes of action in connection with,
our  platform  and  user  data  practices  as  well  as  the  misuse  of  certain  data  by  a  developer  that  shared  such  data  with  third  parties  in  violation  of  our  terms  and,
policies and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. eginning on July 27 2018 two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United,
States  against  us and certain  of our directors  and officers  alleging  violations  of securities  laws in connection  with the  disclosure  of our earnings  results  for  the,
second  quarter  of  2018  and  seeking  unspecified  damages.  These  two  actions  subsequently  were  transferred  and  consolidated  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the,
Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25 2019 the,
district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action with leave to amend. On November 15 2019 an amended complaint,
was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them. In addition our,
platform and user data practices as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
FTC state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the United States Europe and other jurisdictions. In July 2019 we entered into a settlement and,
modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters our settlement,
with the FTC requires us to pay a penalty of 5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Any other,
government inquiries regarding these matters could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources,
and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business.,
,On April 1 2015 a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users alleging
"that the ""tag suggestions"" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois iometric Information Privacy Act and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On",
April 16 2018 the district court certified a class of Illinois residents and on May 14 2018 the district court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.,
On May 29 2018 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On,
August 8 2019 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2 2019 we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of,
the decision of the Ninth Circuit which was denied. On January 15 2020 the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit which will require a,
payment of 550 million by us and is subject to approval by the district court.,
,eginning  on  September  28  2018  multiple  putative  class  actions  were  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  against  us
alleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's,
code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The,
actions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On November 26 2019 the district court,
certified a class for injunctive relief purposes but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16 2020 the parties agreed to a,
settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. We believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them. In addition the events,
surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission IDPC and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us,
to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect,
our business.,
,From  time  to  time  we  also  notify  the  IDPC  our  designated  European  privacy  regulator  under  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  of  certain  other
personal  data  breaches  and  privacy  issues  and  are  subject  to  inquiries  and  investigations  regarding  various  aspects  of  our  regulatory  compliance.  Any  such,
inquiries  or  investigations  could  subject  us  to  substantial  fines  and  costs  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  divert  resources  and  the  attention  of,
management from our business or adversely affect our business.,
,In addition from time to time we are subject to inquiries and investigations formal or informal by competition authorities in the United States Europe and
other jurisdictions. For example in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition beginning in,
the third quarter of 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. These investigations and,
inquiries concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising and/or mobile,
