The U.S. Department of Justice DOJ various U.S. states and other plaintiffs have filed and may continue to file
in  the  future  several  antitrust  lawsuits  about  various  aspects  of  our  business  including  our  advertising  technologies
and  practices  the  operation  and  distribution  of  Google  Search  and  the  operation  and  distribution  of  the  Android
operating system and Play Store.
For  example  the  DOJ  and  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  filed  a  lawsuit  alleging  that  Google  violated
antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising and in August 2024 the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia  ruled  that  Google  violated  such  antitrust  laws.  The  Court  is  holding  a  separate  proceeding  to  determine
remedies  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  services  and  our  business  models  and  operations
including  structural  remedies  and/or  our  distribution  arrangements  among  other  changes.  While  we  plan  to  appeal
there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of
any  remedies  that  may  be  ordered  and  any  or  all  of  these  potential  remedies  could  harm  our  business  reputation
financial condition and operating results.
Also in December 2023 a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated
antitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that
ordered  a  variety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  contractual  agreements  for Android  and
"Google  Play.  We  are  appealing 
the  verdict  but 
if  we  are  unsuccessful  we  could 
face  significant  expenses 
to"
implement the remedies and such costs and alterations could harm our business reputation financial condition and
operating results.
Furthermore  in  December  2020  several  State Attorneys  General  led  by  the  Texas Attorney  General  filed  an
antitrust  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of Texas  alleging  that  Google  violated  antitrust  and
other laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025 and we could face significant
civil penalties. In January 2023 the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging
similar antitrust violations relating to Googleâ€™s advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September
2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If we are unsuccessful we could face an order on remedies that could
harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.
In  addition  to  these  regulatory  proceedings  private  individual  and  collective  actions  that  overlap  with  claims
pursued  by  regulators  are  pending  in  the  U.S.  and  in  several  other  jurisdictions. Adverse  results  in  these  or  similar
future  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  monetary  damages  and  remedies  that  could  harm  our  business  reputation
financial condition and operating results.
Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world including competition enforcers consumer protection
agencies and data protection authorities have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and
"compliance  with 
laws  and  regulations.  We  are  cooperating  with 
these 
investigations  and  defending

safety  hazardous  materials  usage  other  environmental  effects AI  training  development  and  commercialization  or
service  disruptions  or  failures.  Claims  have  been  brought  and  we  expect  will  continue  to  be  brought  against  us  for
