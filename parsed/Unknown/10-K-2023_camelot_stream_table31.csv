,Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions,
and  other  strategic  arrangements  could  cause  us  to  fail  to  realize  their  anticipated  benefits  incur  unanticipated,,
liabilities and harm our business generally.,,
,Our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities,
the  incurrence  of  debt  contingent  liabilities  or  amortization  expenses  or  impairment  of  goodwill  and/or  purchased,,
long-lived  assets  and  restructuring  charges  any  of  which  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and  operating  results.,,
Also  the  anticipated  benefits  or  value  of  our  acquisitions  and  other  strategic  arrangements  may  not  materialize.  In,,
connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain,,
potential liabilities which could harm our financial condition and operating results.,,

qualified personnel or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture we may not be able to grow or,,

,Our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as,
well as members of our senior management team. For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of,,
Alphabet  and  its  subsidiaries  and  plays  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  our  technology  maintaining  our,,

employees.  In  addition  our  compensation  arrangements  such  as  our  equity  award  programs  may  not  always  be,,
successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration,,
policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent. All of our,,
executive  officers  and  key  employees  are  at-will  employees  and  we  do  not  maintain  any  key-person  life  insurance,,
policies.,,
,In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork. As our organization,
grows  and  evolves  we  may  need,to  adapt  our  corporate  culture  and  work  environments,to  ever-changing
circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to,,
compete  effectively  or  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  corporate  culture.  Under  our  hybrid  work  models  we  may,,
experience  increased  costs  and/or  disruption  in  addition  to  potential  effects  on  our  ability  to  operate  effectively  and,,
