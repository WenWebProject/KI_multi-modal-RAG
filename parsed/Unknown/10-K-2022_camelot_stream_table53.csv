Income Taxes,,
,We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating,
our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.,,
"Recording  an  uncertain 
tax  position 
involves  various  qualitative  considerations",including  evaluation  of,
comparable and resolved tax exposures applicability of tax laws and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain,,
tax positions periodically considering changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial,,
opinions  as  well  as  the  status  of  audit  activities  by  taxing  authorities.  Although  we  believe  we  have  adequately,,
reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not,,
be  different.  To  the  extent  that  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  than  the  amounts  recorded  such,,
differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination,,
is made.,,
,The  provision  for  income  taxes  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are,
considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition we are subject to the continuous,,
examination  of  our  income  tax  returns  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Services  IRS  and  other  tax  authorities  which  may,,
"assert  assessments  against  us.  We  regularly  assess 
the","likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting 
from",these
examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.,,
Loss Contingencies,,
,We  are  regularly  subject  to  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government  investigations  other  proceedings  and,
consent orders involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security tax and related compliance labor,,
and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or,,
publishers  using  our  platforms  personal  injury  consumer  protection  and  other  matters.  Certain  of  these  matters,,
include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe,,
that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a,,
loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of,,
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,,
,We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that,
"has  been  previously  accrued  and 
the  matters  and 
related 
reasonably  possible",losses  disclosed  and  make,
adjustments  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  as  appropriate.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  the,,
likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters there,,
may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material.,,
Change in Accounting Estimate,,
,In January 2023 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting,
in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years which we expect to,,
result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately 3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of,,
"December  31  2022  recorded  primarily 
in  cost  of  revenues  and  R&D  expenses.  See  Note  1  of",the  Notes,to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the,,
useful lives of our servers and network equipment.,,
"ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES AOUT MARKET RISK",,
,We  are  exposed  to  financial  market  risks  including  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  interest  rates,
and equity investment risks.,,
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,,
,We  transact  business  globally  in  multiple  currencies.  International  revenues  as  well  as  costs  and  expenses,
denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the,,
U.S.  dollar.  Principal  currencies  hedged  included  the  Australian  dollar  ritish  pound  Canadian  dollar  Euro  and,,
Japanese  yen.  For  the  purpose  of  analyzing  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  we  considered  the  historical  trends  in,,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in  exchange,,
rates of 10 could be experienced.,,
,We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities,
denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the  subsidiary.  These  forward  and  option  contracts,,
reduce  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  assets  and,,
liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense,,
net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.,,
