,Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the
sensitivity  analyses  performed  as  of  December  31  2020  and  2021  due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with,
predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is,
not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.,
Equity Investment Risk,
,Our  marketable  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  subject  to  a  wide  variety  of  market-related  risks  that
could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.,
,Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are
investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages.,
,We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily
determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and,
represent  5.9  billion  and  7.8  billion  of  our,investments  as  of  December  31  2020  and  2021  respectively.  A
hypothetical adverse price change of 10 on our December 31 2021 balance which could be experienced in the near,
term would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by 780 million. From time to time we may enter,
into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.,
,Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  are  adjusted  to  fair  value  for
observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  or  impairment  referred  to  as  the,
measurement  alternative.  The  fair  value  measured  at  the  time  of  the  observable  transaction  is  not  necessarily  an,
indication  of  the  current  fair  value  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  These  investments  especially  those  that  are  in  the,
early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are,
typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which,
could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any,
private  company  is  also  typically  dependent  on  the  likelihood  of  our  ability  to  realize  appreciation  in  the  value  of,
investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events. As of,
December  31  2020  and  2021  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  which  were  accounted  for,
"under 
the  measurement  alternative  was  18.9  billion  and  27.6  billion",respectively.  Valuations  of  our  equity
investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility,
in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-,
marketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with,
changes  in  valuation  of  marketable  equity  securities.  Additionally  observable  transactions  at  lower  valuations  could,
"result 
in  significant","losses  on  our  non-marketable  equity  securities.  The  effect  of  COVID-19  on  our 
impairment"
assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the effect.,
,The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion as
of  December  31  2020  and  2021  respectively  generally  do  not  fluctuate  based  on  market  price  changes.  However,
these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.,
,For  further  information  about  our  equity  investments  see  Note  1  and  Note  3  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
