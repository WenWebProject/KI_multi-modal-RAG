,ecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars
we  have  faced  and  will  continue  to  face  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Although  we,
hedge  a  portion  of  our  international  currency  exposure  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.,
dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently,
risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.,
,Risks Related to our Industry
,People  access  the  Internet  through  a  variety  of  platforms  and  devices  that  continue  to  evolve  with  the
advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of,
our products and services developed for these interfaces our business could be harmed.,
,People  access  the  Internet  through  a  growing  variety  of  devices  such  as  desktop  computers  mobile  phones
smartphones,"laptops  and 
tablets  video  game  consoles  voice-activated  speakers  wearables  automobiles  and"
television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer,
or  distributor  may  establish  unique  technical  standards  for  its  devices  and  our  products  and  services  may  not  be,
available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result.,
Some  manufacturers  may  also  elect  not  to  include  our  products  on  their  devices.  In  addition  search  queries  are,
increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers apps social media or other platforms which could harm,
our  business.  It  is  hard  to  predict  the  challenges  we  may  encounter  in  adapting  our  products  and  services  and,
developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating,
and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial,
number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users or failing to develop products and,
technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating,
results and ability to capture future business opportunities.,
,Data  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating  to  our  technology  and  our  practices  could  damage  our
reputation  cause  us  to  incur  significant  liability  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from,
using  our  products  and  services.  Software  bugs  or  defects  security  breaches  and  attacks  on  our  systems,
could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ and customers’,
ability to use our products and services harming our business operations and reputation.,
Concerns  about,"including 
the  adequacy  of  our  practices  with  regard 
to 
the  collection  use  governance"
disclosure or security of personal information or other data-privacy-related matters even if unfounded could harm our,
reputation financial condition and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations,
and regulations regarding privacy and data change.,
,Our  products  and  services  involve  the  storage  handling  and  transmission  of  proprietary  and  other  sensitive
information. Software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products and services and security breaches,
expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other,
potential  liability  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally  our  products,
incorporate  highly  technical  and  complex  technologies  and  thus  our  technologies  and  software  have  contained  and,
are likely in the future to contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered and may,
in  the  future  discover  some  errors  in  our  software  code  only  after  we  have  released  the  code.  Systems  and  control,
failures security breaches failure to comply with our privacy policies and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could,
result in government and legal exposure seriously harm our reputation brand and business and impair our ability to,
attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the,
scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant,
damage we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of,
bugs theft misuse and security vulnerabilities or breaches.,
,We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.
Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods,
of time. We have seen and will continue to see industry-wide vulnerabilities such as the Log4j vulnerability reported in,
December 2021 which could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such,
