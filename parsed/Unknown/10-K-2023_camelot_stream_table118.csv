"Revenues  certain  costs  such  as  costs  associated  with  content  and 
traffic  acquisition  certain  engineering"
activities  and  devices  as  well  as  certain  operating  expenses  are  directly  attributable  to  our  segments.  Due  to  the
integrated  nature  of  Alphabet  other  costs  and  expenses  such  as  technical  infrastructure  and  office  facilities  are
managed  centrally  at  a  consolidated  level.  These  costs  including  the  associated  depreciation  and  impairment  are
allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage headcount or revenue.
Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets beginning in
the  first  quarter  of  2023  DeepMind  is  reported  as  part  of  Alphabet-level  activities  instead  of  within  Other  ets.
Additionally  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023  we  updated  and  simplified  our  cost  allocation  methodologies  to
provide  our  business  leaders  with  increased  transparency  for  decision-making.  Prior  periods  have  been  recast  to
conform to the current presentation.
As announced on April 20 2023 we brought together part of Google Research the rain team and DeepMind to
significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence AI. The group called Google DeepMind is reported within
"Alphabet-level  activities  prospectively  beginning 
in 
the  second  quarter  of  2023.  Previously 
the  rain 
team  was"
included within Google Services.
Certain  costs  are  not  allocated  to  our  segments  because  they  represent Alphabet-level  activities.  These  costs
primarily  include AI-focused  shared  R&D  activities  including  development  costs  of  our  general AI  models;  corporate
initiatives  such  as  our  philanthropic  activities;  corporate  shared  costs  such  as  certain  finance  human  resource  and
legal  costs  including  certain  fines  and  settlements.  Charges  associated  with  reductions  in  our  workforce  and  office
space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally hedging gains losses related to revenue are not
allocated to our segments.
