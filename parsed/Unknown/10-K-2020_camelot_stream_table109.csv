Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations
As of December 31 2020 we had 10.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related
to data center operations and build-outs digital media content licensing information technology assets and purchases
of inventory.
Indemnifications
In  the  normal  course  of  business  to  facilitate  transactions  in  our  services  and  products  we  indemnify  certain
parties  including  advertisers  Google  Network  Members  customers  of  Google  Cloud  offerings  and  lessors  with
respect  to  certain  matters.  We  have  agreed  to  hold  certain  parties  harmless  against  losses  arising  from  a  breach  of
representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.
Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the
claim.  In  addition  we  have  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  our  officers  and  directors  and  our  bylaws
contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally we have a
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a
material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position. However to the extent that valid
indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
As of December 31 2020 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.
