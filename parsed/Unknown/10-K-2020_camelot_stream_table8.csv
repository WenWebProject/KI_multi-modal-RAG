USINESS",
Overview,
,"As  our  founders  Larry  and  Sergey  wrote  in  the  original  founders'  letter  ""Google  is  not  a  conventional  company."
"We do not intend to become one."" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring",
"us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence ""AI"" research and quantum computing.",
We continue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as,
CEO of Alphabet since 2019.,
,Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google  —  which  we  report  as  two  segments:
Google Services and Google Cloud. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other ets. Our Other ets,
include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and,
manage  the  portfolio  of  Other  ets  with  the  discipline  and  rigor  needed  to  deliver  long-term  returns.  Our  Alphabet,
structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.,
Access and technology for everyone,
,The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers capable of propelling new ideas and people forward.
Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it,
was when we were founded in 1998. Since then we’ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a,
company that helps you get things done. We’re focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we,
aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success.,
,Across  Alphabet  we're  focused  on  continually  innovating  in  areas  where  technology  can  have  an  impact  on
people’s lives. Every year there are trillions of searches on Google and we continue to invest deeply in AI and other,
technologies  to  ensure  the  most  helpful  Search  experience  possible.  People  come  to  YouTube  for  entertainment,
information  and  opportunities  to  learn  something  new.  And  Google  Assistant  offers  the  best  way  to  get  things  done,
seamlessly across different devices providing intelligent help throughout your day no matter where you are.,
,Since  the  pandemic  began  our  teams  have  built  new  features  to  help  users  go  about  their  daily  lives  and  to
support businesses working to serve their customers during an uncertain time. In conjunction with Apple we launched,
Exposure  Notification  apps  that  are  being  used  by  local  governments  globally.  Our  COVID-19  Community  Mobility,
Reports  are  used  by  public  health  agencies  and  researchers  around  the  globe  and  we’ve  committed  hundreds  of,
millions  of  dollars  to  help  small  businesses  through  a  combination  of  small  business  loans  grants  and  ad  credits.,
Importantly we've made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users,
search for trusted public health information.,
,Our Other ets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance as a part of our efforts in the Metro
Phoenix area Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is,
developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.,
Moonshots,
,Many  companies  get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done  making  only  incremental  changes.  This
incrementalism  leads  to  irrelevance  over  time  especially  in  technology  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary  not,
evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,
but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser.,
We  continue  to  look  toward  the  future  and  continue  to  invest  for  the  long-term.  As  we  said  in  the  original  founders',
letter we will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-,
term success.,
The power of machine learning,
,Across  the  company  machine  learning  and  AI  are  increasingly  driving  many  of  our  latest  innovations.  Our
investments in machine learning over the past decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more,
helpful. For example a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding called ERT now improves results for,
almost every English language search query.,
,DeepMind made a significant AI-powered breakthrough solving a 50-year-old protein folding challenge which will
help  us  better  understand  one  of  life’s  fundamental  building  blocks  and  will  enable  researchers  to  tackle  new  and,
difficult problems from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability.,
