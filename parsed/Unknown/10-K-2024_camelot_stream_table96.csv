Unconsolidated VIEs,,
,We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies,
that  are  primarily  early  stage  companies  and  certain  renewable  energy  entities  in  which  activities  involve  power,,
generation using renewable sources.,,
,We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that,
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and the results of,,
operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account,,
for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments which are included,,
"within 
non-marketable","securities 
on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets.  The  maximum","exposure 
of 
these"
unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future  funding,,
commitments.  As  of  December  31  2023  and  2024  our  future  funding  commitments  related  to  unconsolidated  VIE,,
