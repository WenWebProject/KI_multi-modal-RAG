Consolidated VIEs,,,,
,We  consolidate  VIEs  in  which  we  hold  a  variable  interest  and  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  The  results  of,,,
operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.,,,,
,For certain consolidated VIEs their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to,,,
us. As of December 31 2021 and September 30 2022 assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these,,,,
VIEs were 6.0 billion and 4.8 billion respectively and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the,,,,
VIEs were 2.5 billion and 2.7 billion respectively.,,,,
,As of December 31 2021 and September 30 2022 total noncontrolling interests NCI including redeemable,,,
noncontrolling interests RNCI in our consolidated subsidiaries were 4.3 billion and 3.9 billion respectively. NCI,,,,
and  RNCI  are  included  within  additional  paid-in  capital.  Net  loss  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  was  not,,,,
"material for any period presented and is included within the ""other"" component of other income expense net. See",,,,
Note 6 for further details on other income expense net.,,,,
Unconsolidated VIEs,,,,
We  have,"investments 
in  VIEs",in  which  we  are  not,the  primary  beneficiary.  These  VIEs,include  private
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve,,,,
power generation using renewable sources.,,,,
,We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that,,,
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and the results,,,,
of  operations  and  financial  position  of  these  VIEs  are  not  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  We,,,,
account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.,,,,
,The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the,,,
investments  and  any  future  funding  commitments.  We  have  determined  that  the  single  source  of  our  exposure  to,,,,
these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated,,,,
VIEs  were  2.7  billion  and  2.9  billion  respectively  as  of  December  31  2021  and  2.6  billion  and  2.6  billion,,,,
respectively as of September 30 2022.,,,,
