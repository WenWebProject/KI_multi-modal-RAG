We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our  tax  obligations  including  income  and  non-income  taxes  are  based  in  part  on  our  corporate  operating  structure  and  intercompany  arrangements
including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany
transactions.  The  tax  laws  applicable  to  our  business  including  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  other  jurisdictions  are  subject  to  interpretation  and  certain
jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. We are subject to
regular  review  and  audit  by  U.S.  federal  state  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  Tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  certain  positions  we  have  taken  including  our
methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide
effective tax rate increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows. For
example in 2016 and 2018 the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the
2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a
manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results.
The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many
transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and
any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and
estimates  of  our  non-income  tax  liabilities  are  reasonable  the  ultimate  settlement  may  differ  from  the  amounts  recorded  in  our  financial  statements  and  may
materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles.
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows.
The  tax  regimes  we  are  subject  to  or  operate  under  including  income  and  non-income  taxes  are  unsettled  and  may  be  subject  to  significant  change.
Changes  in  tax  laws  or  tax  rulings  or  changes  in  interpretations  of  existing  laws  could  materially  affect  our  financial  position  results  of  operations  and  cash
flows. For example the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for
the fourth quarter of 2017 and the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act could materially affect our tax obligations and
effective tax rate in the period issued. In addition a three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner
regarding the treatment of share-based compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement which had a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax
rate  for  the  second  quarter  of  2019.  As  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  hearing  before  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  the  final  outcome  of  the  case  is
uncertain  and  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  tax  obligations  and  effective  tax  rate  in  future  quarters.  In  addition  many  countries  in  Europe  as  well  as  a
number  of  other  countries  and  organizations  have  recently  proposed  or  recommended  changes  to  existing  tax  laws  or  have  enacted  new  laws  that  could
significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a ase Erosion and Profit Shifting Project and issued a report in 2015
an interim report in 2018 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our
tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Similarly the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals
that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate
income  tax  as  well  as  proposals  to  change  or  impose  new  types  of  non-income  taxes  including  taxes  based  on  a  percentage  of  revenue.  For  example  several
countries have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces and
would likely apply to our business.
The  European  Commission  has  conducted  investigations  in  multiple  countries  focusing  on  whether  local  country  tax  rulings  or  tax  legislation  provides
preferential  tax treatment  that  violates  European Union state  aid  rules and concluded  that certain  countries  including  Ireland  have provided  illegal  state aid in
certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.
Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above
could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non-income taxes
