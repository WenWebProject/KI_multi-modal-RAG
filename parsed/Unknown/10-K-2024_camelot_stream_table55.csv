with variable terms we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as,
of  December  31  2024.  In  certain  instances  the  amount  of  our  contractual  obligations  may  change  based  on  the,
expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses see Note,

,In  addition  we  regularly  enter  into  multi-year  non-cancellable  agreements  to  purchase  renewable  energy  and
energy  attributes  such  as  renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not,include  a  minimum  dollar
commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and,
are not readily determinable.,
Critical Accounting Estimates,
,We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  doing  so  we  have  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions.  Our  critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  involve  a  significant  level  of,
uncertainty  at  the  time  the  estimate  was  made  and  changes  in  them  have  had  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a,
material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly actual results could differ materially from,
our  estimates.  We  base  our  estimates  on  past  experience  and  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable,
under  the  circumstances  and  we  evaluate  these  estimates  on  an  ongoing  basis.  We  have  reviewed  our  critical,
accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our oard of Directors.,
,For  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  the  effect  on  our  financial  statements  see  Note  1  of  the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
Fair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities,
,We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our non-
"marketable  equity  securities. These  investments  are  accounted  for  under  the  measurement  alternative  method  ""the",
"measurement alternative"" and are measured at cost less impairment subject to upward and downward adjustments",
resulting  from  observable  price  changes  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer.  These  adjustments,
require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs.,
Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of,
estimates using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.,
,Non-marketable  equity  securities  are  also  evaluated  for  impairment  based  on  qualitative  factors  including  the
"companies' 
financial  and 
liquidity  position  and  access","to  capital  resources  among  others.  When 
indicators  of"
impairment  exist  we  prepare  quantitative  measurements  of  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  investments  using  a  market,
approach  or  an  income  approach  which  requires  judgment  and  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  including  discount,
rates  investee  revenues  and  costs  and  comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies  among  others.,
When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists we write down the investment to its,
current fair value.,
,We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments i.e.
performance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis which may,
result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use,
of unobservable inputs.,
Property and Equipment,
,We  assess  the  reasonableness  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  property  and  equipment  periodically  as  well  as  when
other changes occur such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations changes in the planned use,
and  utilization  of  assets  or  technological  advancements  that  could  indicate  a  change  in  the  period  over  which  we,
expect to benefit from the asset.,
Income Taxes,
,We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating
our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.,
"Recording  an  uncertain 
tax  position 
involves  various  qualitative  considerations",including  evaluation  of
comparable and resolved tax exposures applicability of tax laws and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain,
tax positions periodically considering changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial,
opinions  as  well  as  the  status  of  audit  activities  by  taxing  authorities.  Although  we  believe  we  have  adequately,
reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not,
be  different.  To  the  extent  that  the  final  tax  outcome  of  these  matters  is  different  than  the  amounts  recorded  such,
