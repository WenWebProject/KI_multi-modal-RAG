Purchase Commitments,
,As of September 30 2023 we had material contractual obligations of 44.3 billion of which 29.4 billion was
short-term.  These  amounts  primarily  consist  of  purchase  orders  for  certain  technical  infrastructure  as  well  as  the,
non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase,
licenses including content licenses inventory and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms we,
do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30,
2023. In certain instances the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of,
order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses see Note 9 of the Notes to,
