Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability,
,We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of
our  core  values  at  Google  and  we  strive  to  build  sustainability  into  everything  we  do.  We  have  been  a  leader  on,
sustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago.,
,Our  sustainability  work  is  focused  on  empowering  individuals  to  take  action  working  together  with  our  partners
and customers and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.,
,In 2020 we shared our aspiration to help individuals cities and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of
their  carbon  equivalent  emissions  annually  by  2030.  This  is  an  ambitious  vision  that  we  have  set  to  push  us  to,
contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.,
,In 2021 we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by
2030.  To  accomplish  this  we  aim  to  reduce  50  of  our  combined  Scope  1  Scope  2  market-based  and  Scope  3,
absolute emissions versus our 2019 baseline before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based,
carbon  removal  solutions  to  neutralize  our  remaining  emissions.  We  have  formally  committed  to  the  Science  ased,
Targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.,
,One of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017 we
have matched 100 of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an,
annual  basis.  However  because  of  differences  in  the  availability  of  renewable  energy  sources  like  solar  and  wind,
across the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on,
carbon-emitting energy sources  that power  local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy,
CFE on every grid where we operate by 2030.,
,Achieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path
to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results particularly where,
they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve we,
expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.,
,To  benefit  the  people  and  places  where  we  operate  we  have  set  goals  to  replenish  120  of  the  freshwater
volume we consume on average across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the,
quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate.,
,We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations products and supply chains. Our
circularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start keeping materials in use for as long as possible and,
promoting healthy materials—for our data centers workplaces and products.,
,More  information  on  our  approach  to  sustainability  can  be  found  in  our  annual  sustainability  reports  including
Google’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this,
Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about,
risks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals see Item 1A Risk Factors of,

take  care  of  the  diverse  needs  of  our  employees  and  their  families  including  opportunities  for  career  growth  and,

compensation  programs  help  us  to  attract  and  retain  top  candidates  and  we  will  continue  to  invest  in  recruiting,
talented  people  to  technical  and  non-technical  roles  and  rewarding  them  well.  We  provide  a  variety  of  high  quality,
training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers to,

,At Alphabet we are committed to making diversity equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a
workforce  that  is  representative  of  the  users  we  serve.  More  information  on  Google’s  approach  to  diversity  can  be,
found in our annual diversity reports available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not,
incorporated  by  reference  into  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  or  in  any  other  report  or  document  we  file  with  the,
