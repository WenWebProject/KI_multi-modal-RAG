,We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active,,,,
or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value and share repurchases or dividends could,,,,,
increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.,,,,,
,We  engage  in  share  repurchases  of  our  Class  A  and  Class  C  stock  from  time  to  time  in  accordance  with,,,,
authorizations from the oard of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and,,,,,
does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In,,,,,
April 2024 we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our,,,,,
Class A Class  and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our oard,,,,,
"of  Directors 
in",its  sole  discretion  and,,in  accordance  with,the  requirements  of  any  applicable,laws  rules  and
regulations  including  the  Delaware  General  Corporation  Law.  Our  cash  dividend  program  does  not  require  and  our,,,,,
oard  of  Directors  may  decide  not  to  declare  a  cash  dividend  each  quarter  and  does  not  obligate  our  oard  of,,,,,
Directors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our oard of Directors,,,,,
may  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors  that  it  may  deem  relevant  including  but  not  limited  to  our  earnings  liquidity,,,,,
financial condition other capital deployment opportunities level of indebtedness and general market conditions. Our,,,,,

,The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.,,,,
,Our Class  stock has 10 votes per share our Class A stock has one vote per share and our Class C stock has,,,,
no voting rights. As of December 31 2024 Larry Page and Sergey rin beneficially owned approximately 87.4 of our,,,,,
outstanding  Class    stock  which  represented  approximately  52.1  of  the  voting  power  of  our  outstanding  common,,,,,
stock.  Through,their  stock  ownership  Larry  and  Sergey  have  significant,,,influence  over  all  matters,requiring
stockholder  approval  including  the  election  of  directors  and  significant  corporate  transactions  such  as  a  merger  or,,,,,
other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future. In addition because our Class C stock carries no,,,,,
voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the Class C stock including in future stock-based,,,,,
acquisition  transactions  and  to  fund  employee  equity  incentive  programs  could  continue  Larry  and  Sergey’s  current,,,,,
relative  voting  power  and  their  ability  to  elect  all  of  our  directors  and  to  determine  the  outcome  of  most  matters,,,,,
submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also,,,,,
affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’,,,,,
ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,,,,,
which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.,,,,,
