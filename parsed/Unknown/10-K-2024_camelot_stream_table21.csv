,Problematic content on our platforms including low-quality user-generated content web spam content
farms  and  other  violations  of  our  guidelines  could  affect  the  quality  of  our  services  which  could  harm  our,
reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.,
"We 
like  others 
in 
the","industry 
face  violations  of  our  content  guidelines  across  our  platforms 
including"
sophisticated  attempts  by  bad  actors  to  manipulate  our  hosting  and  advertising  systems  to  fraudulently  generate,
revenues  or  to  otherwise  generate  traffic  that  does  not  represent  genuine  user  interest  or  intent.  While  we  invest,
significantly  in  efforts  to  promote  high-quality  and  relevant  results  and  to  detect  and  prevent  low-quality  content  and,
invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote,
uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of,
abuse for bad actors.,
,Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in
search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have,
affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading,
or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam,
in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their,
rankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our,
platforms  there  is  no  guarantee  that  our  technology  will  always  be  successful  and  our  users  may  have  negative,
experiences  on  our  platforms  if  our  technology  fails  to  work  as  intended  which  may  affect  our  users'  decisions  in,
continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelevant  content  websites,
including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve,
their  search rankings. We are continually  launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from,
low-quality websites but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms including,
violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference; activities that threaten,
the  safety  and/or  well-being  of  our  users  including  minors  on-  or  off-line;  and  the  spreading  of  misinformation  or,
disinformation.,
,If  we  fail  to  either  detect  and  prevent  an  increase  in  problematic  content  or  effectively  promote  high-quality
content  it  could  hurt  our  reputation  for  delivering  relevant  information  or  reduce  use  of  our  platforms  harming  our,
financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions which could result in,
monetary penalties and damages and divert managementâ€™s time and attention.,
,Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet
access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and,
services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.,
,Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products
require  significant  network  capacity  to  work  effectively.  Currently  this  access  is  provided  by  companies  that  have,
"significant  market  power 
in","the  broadband  and 
internet  access  marketplace 
including 
incumbent 
telephone"
companies cable companies mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Some of,
these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the,
cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or,
facilitate  our  offerings  by  charging  increased  fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  provide  our  offerings  or  by  providing  our,
competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination,
by  internet  access  providers;  however  substantial  uncertainty  exists  in  the  U.S.  and  elsewhere  regarding  such,
protections.  In  addition  in  some  jurisdictions  our  products  and  services  have  been  subject  to  government-initiated,
restrictions  or  blockages.  These  could  harm  existing  key,"relationships 
including  with  our  users  customers"
advertisers  and/or  content  providers  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  ones;  harm  our  reputation;  and  increase,
costs thereby negatively affecting our business.,
Risks Related to Laws Regulations and Policies,
,We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  new  existing  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide  that  could
harm our business and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue,
to expand our business.,
,We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety
of subjects and our introduction of new businesses products services and technologies will likely continue to subject,
us to additional laws and regulations. In recent years governments around the world have proposed and adopted a,
large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy particularly in the areas of data privacy and,
security competition AI and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to,
increase in the future including as a result of differing and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations.,
