,Our  international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow
internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  51  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2022.  In,
addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the,
following:,
•,restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent
,us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;
•,import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from
,offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies
,and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs;
•,longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
•,an  evolving  foreign  policy  landscape  that  may  adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  new
,regulatory  costs  and  challenges  including  new  customer  requirements  in  addition  to  other  adverse  effects
,that we are unable to effectively anticipate;
•,sanctions  export  controls  and  trade  restrictions  that  limit  our  ability  to  operate  in  certain  jurisdictions  or  to
,comply with local laws including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts such as the ongoing
,conflict in Ukraine;
•,political unrest conflict and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of
,our products and services may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and
,services or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;
