downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increasing costs,
for many aspects of our business. Further certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and,
may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base,
successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue,
growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information,
see  Trends  in  Our  usiness  and  Financial  Effect  and  Revenues  and  Monetization  Metrics  in  Part  II  Item  7  of  this,

,Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of
our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.,
,Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for
us. Various events  outside of  our  control  pose a  threat  to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products,
services and technologies. For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country,
in  which  our  products  and  services  are  distributed  or  made  available  through  the  Internet. Also  the  efforts  we  have,
taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection,
for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover we may not have,
adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the,
possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or,
unenforceable.,
,We  also  seek  to  maintain  certain  intellectual  property  as  trade  secrets.  The  secrecy  of  such  trade  secrets  and
other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting,
from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example there is a risk that the word,
“Google”  could  become  so  commonly  used  that  it  becomes  synonymous  with  the  word  “search.”  Some  courts  have,
"ruled that ""Google"" is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the U.S.",
may reach a different determination. If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in,
other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand.,
,Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.
Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of,
our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating,
results.,
,Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our
ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners.,
,Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the
brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other ets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch,
new  and  innovative  products  and  services  that  better  serve  the  needs  of  our  users  advertisers  customers  content,
providers  and  other  partners.  Our  brands  have  been  and  may  in  the  future  be  negatively  affected  by  a  number  of,
factors  including  among  others  reputational  issues  third-party  content  shared  on  our  platforms  data  privacy  and,
security  issues  and  developments  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example  if  we  fail  to  respond,
appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable,
practices  by  advertisers  or  otherwise  to  adequately  address  user  concerns  our  users  may  lose  confidence  in  our,
brands.,
,Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business reputation financial condition
and  operating  results.  Our  success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to,
provide  high-quality  trustworthy  innovative  products  and  services  that  are  truly  useful  and  play  a  valuable  role  in  a,
range of settings.,
,We  face  a  number  of  manufacturing  and  supply  chain  risks  that  could  harm  our  business  financial
condition and operating results.,
,We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability
to supply both our products and our services.,
We  rely  on  contract  manufacturers,to  manufacture  or  assemble  our  devices  and  servers  and  networking
equipment  used  in  our  technical  infrastructure  and  we  may  supply  the  contract  manufacturers  with  components  to,
assemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and,
distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these,
companies  with  the  necessary  capabilities  or  capacity  on  reasonable  terms  or  if  those  we  engage  fail  to  meet  their,
