the  pandemic  we  have,focused,in  particular  on,features,that  help  people,in,their  daily,lives  and,that  support
businesses working to serve their customers. For example we have added live busyness trends in Google Maps that,,,,,,,,
help users instantly spot when a neighborhood or part of town is near or at its busiest. We have also helped businesses,,,,,,,,
navigate uncertainty during an uneven economic recovery and we have worked to address the complex challenge of,,,,,,,,
distributing critical information about COVID-19 vaccines to billions of people around the world. Importantly we have,,,,,,,,
made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users find trusted public,,,,,,,,
health information.,,,,,,,,
,Other  ets  also  remain  focused  on  innovation  through  technology  that  can  positively  affect  people's  lives.  For,,,,,,,
instance  Waymo  is  working  toward  our  goal  of  making  transportation  safer  and  easier  for  everyone  and  Verily  is,,,,,,,,
developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.,,,,,,,,
Moonshots,,,,,,,,
,Many  companies  get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done  making  only  incremental  changes.  This,,,,,,,
incrementalism  leads  to  irrelevance  over  time  especially  in  technology  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary  not,,,,,,,,
evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,,,,,,,,
but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser.,,,,,,,,
We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the,,,,,,,,
original founders' letter we will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects that we believe in as they are the key,,,,,,,,
to our long-term success.,,,,,,,,
The power of AI,,,,,,,,
"Across 
the  company",investments,,in  AI  and  machine,learning  are,increasingly  driving  many  of  our,,,latest
innovations and have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example in May of 2021 we,,,,,,,,
introduced Multitask Unified Model — or MUM — which has the potential to transform how Google helps with complex,,,,,,,,
tasks.  MUM  is  trained  across  75  different  languages  which  means  that  it  can  learn  from  sources  written  in  one,,,,,,,,
language  and  help  bring  that  information  to  people  in  another.  It  is  also  multimodal  so  it  understands  information,,,,,,,,
across  text  and  images  and  in  the  future  can  expand  to  more  modalities  like  video  and  audio.  We  are  currently,,,,,,,,
experimenting with MUM’s capabilities to make searching more natural and intuitive and even enable entirely new ways,,,,,,,,
to search.,,,,,,,,
,DeepMind  also  made  a  significant  AI-powered  breakthrough  solving  a  50-year-old  protein  folding  challenge,,,,,,,
which  will  help  the  world  better  understand  one  of  life’s  fundamental  building  blocks  and  will  enable  researchers  to,,,,,,,,
tackle new and difficult problems from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. DeepMind has since shared its,,,,,,,,
new  AlphaFold  protein  structure  database  which  doubled  the  number  of  high-accuracy  human  protein  structures,,,,,,,,
available to researchers.,,,,,,,,
Google,,,,,,,,
,For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.,,,,,,,
Google Services,,,,,,,,
Serving our users,,,,,,,,
,We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of,,,,,,,
people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the,,,,,,,,
world.  Google  Services'  core  products  and  platforms  include  ads  Android  Chrome  hardware  Gmail  Google  Drive,,,,,,,,
Google  Maps  Google  Photos  Google  Play  Search  and  YouTube  each  with  broad  and  growing  adoption  by  users,,,,,,,,
around the world.,,,,,,,,
,Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.,,,,,,,
Rather  than  the  ten  blue  links  in  our  early  search  results  users  can  now  get  direct  answers  to  their  questions  using,,,,,,,,
their  computer  mobile  device  or  their  own  voice  making  it  quicker  easier  and  more  natural  to  find  what  they  are,,,,,,,,
looking for.,,,,,,,,
,This  drive  to  make  information  more  accessible  and  helpful  has  led  us  over  the  years  to  improve  the  discovery,,,,,,,
and  creation  of  digital  content  both  on  the  web  and  through  platforms  like  Google  Play  and  YouTube.  With  the,,,,,,,,
continued  adoption  of  mobile  people  are  consuming  more  digital  content  by  watching  more  videos  playing  more,,,,,,,,
games  listening  to  more  music  reading  more  books  and  using  more  apps  than  ever  before.  Working  with  content,,,,,,,,
creators and partners we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content.,,,,,,,,
,Fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to,,,,,,,
invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system Chrome browser and Chrome operating system as,,,,,,,,
