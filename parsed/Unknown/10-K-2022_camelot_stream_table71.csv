Non-Marketable Securities,,,
,We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have,,
control over the investee under the equity method All other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily,,,
accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative the carrying value is measured,,,
at cost less any impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for,,,
identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach,,,
as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income expense net.,,,
,Non-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.,,
,Non-marketable  securities  that  do  not  have  effective  contractual  maturity  dates  are  classified  as  other  non-,,

Derivative Financial Instruments,,,
,See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.,,
Accounts Receivable,,,
,Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or,,
services  offered.  The  term  between  invoicing  and  when  payment  is  due  is  not  significant.  For  certain  products  or,,,
services  and  customers  we,"require  payment  before 
the  products  or  services  are  delivered",to,the  customer.
Additionally  accounts  receivable  includes  amounts  for  services  performed  in  advance  of  the  right  to  invoice  the,,,
customer.,,,
,We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable which is recorded as an offset to accounts,,
receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements,,,
of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics,,,
exist  and  on  an  individual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or  collectibility  issues.  In,,,
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status,,,
and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider,,,
customer-specific information current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic,,,
conditions.,,,
Other,,,
,Our  financial  instruments  also  include  debt  and  equity  investments  in  companies  with  which  we  also  have,,
commercial arrangements. For these transactions judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements,,,
"whether 
the  arrangements  and  each  component  of",the  arrangements  should  be  accounted,,for  as  separate
transactions  under,"the  applicable  GAAP  as  well  as 
the  determination  of 
the  value  of",the  components  of,the
arrangements including the fair value of the investments.,,,
Impairment of Investments,,,
,We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.,,
,For  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss  position  we  determine  whether  a  credit  loss  exists. The  credit  loss  is,,
estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past,,,
events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other,,,
income expense net not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss,,,
are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt,,,
security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis we will write down the security to its,,,
fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net.,,,
,For  non-marketable  equity  securities  including  equity  method  investments  we  consider  whether  impairment,,
indicators  exist  by  evaluating  the  companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  and  access  to  capital  resources  among,,,
other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair,,,
value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net. We prepare quantitative,,,
measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.,,,
