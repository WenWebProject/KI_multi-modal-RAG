invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to adequately detect and prevent all such abuses or,,,,,
promote uniformly high-quality content.,,,,,
,Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in,,,,
search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have,,,,,
affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading,,,,,
or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam,,,,,
in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their,,,,,
rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results including through indexing technology that makes it,,,,,
harder  for  spam-like  less  useful  web  content  to  rank  highly.  We  also  continue  to  invest  in  and  deploy  proprietary,,,,,
technology  to  detect  and  prevent  web  spam  on  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and,,,,,
irrelevant  content  websites  including  content  farms  which  are  websites  that  generate  large  quantities  of  low-quality,,,,,
content  to  help  them  improve  their  search  rankings.  We  are  continually  launching  algorithmic  changes  designed  to,,,,,
detect  and  prevent  abuse  from  low-quality  websites.  We  also  face  other  challenges  on  our  platforms  including,,,,,
violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference activities that threaten,,,,,
the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.,,,,,
,If  we  fail  to  either  detect  and  prevent  an  increase  in  problematic  content  or  effectively  promote  high-quality,,,,
content  it  could  hurt  our  reputation  for  delivering  relevant  information  or  reduce  use  of  our  platforms  harming  our,,,,,
financial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory action which could result in,,,,,
monetary penalties and damages and divert managementâ€™s time and attention.,,,,,
,Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet,,,,
access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and,,,,,
services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.,,,,,
,Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products,,,,
require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently this access is provided by companies that have significant,,,,,
market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access  marketplace  including  incumbent  telephone  companies  cable,,,,,
companies  mobile  communications  companies  and  government-owned  service  providers.  Some  of  these  providers,,,,,
have  taken  or  have  stated  that  they  may  take  measures  that  could  degrade  disrupt  or  increase  the  cost  of  user,,,,,
access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our,,,,,
offerings  by  charging  increased  fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  provide  our  offerings  or  by  providing  our  competitors,,,,,
preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet,,,,,
access  providers;  however  substantial  uncertainty  exists  in  the  U.S.  and  elsewhere  regarding  such  protections.  For,,,,,
example  in  2018  the  U.S.  Federal  Communications  Commission  repealed  net  neutrality  rules  which  could  permit,,,,,
internet  access  providers  to  restrict  block  degrade  or  charge  for  access  to  certain  of  our  products  and  services.  In,,,,,
addition  in  some  jurisdictions  our  products  and  services  have  been  subject  to  government-initiated  restrictions  or,,,,,
blockages.  These  could  harm  existing  key  relationships  including  with  our  users  customers  advertisers  and/or,,,,,
content  providers  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  ones;  damage  our  reputation;  and  increase  costs  thereby,,,,,
negatively affecting our business.,,,,,
,Risks Related to Laws Regulations and Policies,,,,
,We  face  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  as  well  as  changes  in  regulatory  conditions  laws  and  policies,,,,
governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business.,,,,,
,We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and,,,,
other proceedings. For instance the U.S. Department of Justice joined by a number of state Attorneys General filed,,,,,
an antitrust complaint against Google on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to,,,,,
Search and Search advertising. Similarly on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust,,,,,
complaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S.,,,,,
antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state  deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology.  Various  other  regulatory,,,,,
agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world  including  competition  enforcers  consumer  protection  agencies  data,,,,,
protection authorities grand juries inter-agency consultative groups and a range of other governmental bodies have,,,,,
and  continue  to  review  and  in  some  cases  challenge  our  products  and  services  and  their  compliance  with  laws  and,,,,,
regulations  around,the  world.  We  continue,to  cooperate  with,these,investigations  and  defend,litigation  where
appropriate.  Various  laws  regulations  investigations  enforcement  lawsuits  and  regulatory  actions  have  in  the  past,,,,,
and  may  in  the  future  result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties  injunctive  relief  ongoing  auditing  and  monitoring,,,,,
obligations  changes  to  our  products  and  services  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  collateral,,,,,
litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results.,,,,,
