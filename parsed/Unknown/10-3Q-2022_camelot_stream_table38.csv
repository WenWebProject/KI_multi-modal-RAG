We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.,
Non-Income Taxes,
,We  are  under  audit  by  various  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities  with  regards  to  non-income  tax  matters.
The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied,
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We,
accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by  or  any  negotiated  agreements  with  these  tax,
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and,
the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity,
and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially,
different from our expectations.,
For information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 13.,
