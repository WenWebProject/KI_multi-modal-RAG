NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unaudited
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
asis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States GAAP and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations. As such the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2019.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 2019 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but
does not include all disclosures including notes required by GAAP.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Facebook Inc. subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests and any
variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for
the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31 2020.
Reclassifications
Certain  prior year  amounts  on the condensed  consolidated  statements  of cash  flow have been  reclassified  to conform to the current  year presentation.  A
reclassification  was  made  to  net  the  changes  in  operating  lease  right-of  use  assets  with  operating  lease  liabilities.  This  net  change  was  not  material  and  was
included within the changes in other liabilities in cash flows from operating activities on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flow for the three months
ended  March  31  2019.  This  change  does  not  affect  previously  reported  cash  flows  from  operating  activities  in  the  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  cash
flows. This reclassification had no effect on our other condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ended March 31 2020 and 2019.
Use of Estimates
Conformity  with  GAAP  requires  the  use  of  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and
accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent
from  other  sources.  We  base  our estimates  and  judgments  on historical  information  and  on various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  under  the
circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas including but not limited to those related to income taxes loss contingencies
fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill collectibility of accounts receivable fair value of financial instruments credit losses of available-for-sale
AFS debt securities leases useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment and revenue recognition. These estimates are based on management's
knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions which may cause further business
slowdowns or shutdowns depress demand for our advertising business and adversely impact our results of operations. During the three months ended March 31
2020 we faced increasing uncertainties around our estimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses. We expect uncertainties around our
key  accounting  estimates  to  continue  to  evolve  depending  on  the  duration  and  degree  of  impact  associated  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Our estimates  may
change as new events occur and additional information emerges and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.
