We  believe  these  complaints  are  without  merit  and  will  defend  ourselves  vigorously.  We  continue  to  cooperate
with federal and state regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that
certain of our products services and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these
lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or  orders
preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have to change
our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for
us  and  otherwise  harm  our  business.  In  addition  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  ITC  has  increasingly
become  an  important  forum  to  litigate  intellectual  property  disputes  because  an  ultimate  loss  in  an  ITC  action  can
result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing  infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  ecause  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market  a
prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important
products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore  many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  require  us  to  indemnify  them  against
certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition our
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions
or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

have a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data
incidents  that  we  report  to  relevant  regulators  as  required  by  law.  Such  claims  lawsuits  regulatory  and  government
investigations other proceedings and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties injunctive relief
ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations changes to our products and services alterations to our business models
and  operations  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences  all  of  which  could  harm  our
business reputation financial condition and operating results.
We  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding
penalties  have  been  imposed  upon  us  in  connection  with  disputes  regarding  the  termination  of  accounts  including
those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.
