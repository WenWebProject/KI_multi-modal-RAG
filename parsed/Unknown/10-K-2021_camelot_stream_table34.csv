Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  —  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other ets. Other ets
include  earlier  stage  technologies  that  are  further  afield  from  our  core  Google  business.  For  further  details  on  our
segments  see  Part  I  Item  1  “usiness”  and  Note  15  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trends in Our usiness and Financial Effect
The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate
that they will continue to affect our future results:
"•
Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves."
The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception
contributing to revenue growth and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.
"•
Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services and"
our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.
Our  users  are  accessing  the  Internet  via  diverse  devices  and  modalities  such  as  smartphones  wearables  and
smart home devices and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are
focused  on  expanding  our  products  and  services  to  stay  in  front  of  these  trends  in  order  to  maintain  and  grow  our
business.
"We  are 
increasingly  generating  advertising  revenues 
from  different  channels 
including  mobile  and  newer"
advertising  formats.  The  margins  on  advertising  revenues  from  these  channels  and  newer  products  have  generally
been  lower  than  those  from  traditional  desktop  search.  Additionally  as  the  market  for  a  particular  device  type  or
modality  matures  our  revenues  may  be  affected.  For  example  growth  in  the  global  smartphone  market  has  slowed
due  to  various  factors  including  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries  which  can  affect  our  mobile
advertising revenue growth rates.
We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow
"and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues ""TAC rate"" to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic"
mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product
mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.
We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins.
"•
As  online  advertising  evolves  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings  which  may  affect  our"
monetization.
As  interactions  between  users  and  advertisers  change  and  as  online  user  behavior  evolves  we  continue  to
expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs. Over time we expect our monetization trends
to  fluctuate.  For  example  we  have  seen  an  increase  in  revenues  from  ads  on  YouTube  and  Google  Play  which
monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.
"•
As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets"
continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.
The shift to online as well as the advent of the multi-device world has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.
including  in  emerging  markets  such  as  India.  We  continue  to  invest  heavily  and  develop  localized  versions  of  our
products  and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased
revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these
markets  particularly  as  low-cost  mobile  devices  become  more  available.  This  trend  could  affect  our  revenues  as
developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
