reporting  as  defined  in  Rule  13a-15f  of  the  Exchange  Act.  Our  management  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  management  recognizes  that  any  controls
and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives. In addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs.
