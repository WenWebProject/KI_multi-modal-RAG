,We use value-at-risk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value
of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for,
our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with,
95 confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31,
2022 and 2023 are shown below in millions:,

,Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the
sensitivity  analyses  performed  as  of  December  31  2022  and  2023  due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with,
predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is,
not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.,
Equity Investment Risk,
,Our  marketable  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  subject  to  a  wide  variety  of  market-related  risks  that
could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.,
,Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are
investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages.,
,We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily
determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and,
represent  5.2  billion  and  6.0  billion  of  our,investments  as  of  December  31  2022  and  2023  respectively.  A
hypothetical  adverse  price  change  of  10  on  our  December  31  2023  balance  would  decrease  the  fair  value  of,
marketable  equity  securities  by  597  million.  From  time  to  time  we  may  enter  into  derivatives  to  hedge  the  market,
price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.,
,Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  are  adjusted  to  fair  value  for
observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  or  impairment  referred  to  as  the,
measurement  alternative.  The  fair  value  measured  at  the  time  of  the  observable  transaction  is  not  necessarily  an,
indication  of  the  current  fair  value  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date. These  investments  especially  those  that  are  in  the,
early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are,
typically  in  the  early  phases  and  may  never  materialize  and  they  may  experience  a  decline  in  financial  condition,
which  could  result  in  a  loss  of  a  substantial  part  of  our  investment  in  these  companies.  Valuations  of  our  equity,
investments  in  private  companies  are  inherently  more  complex  due  to  the  lack  of  readily  available  market  data  and,
observable  transactions  at  lower  valuations  could  result  in  significant  losses.  In  addition  global  economic  conditions,
could result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on,
the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public,
offerings  acquisitions  private  sales  or  other  market  events.  Changes  in  the  valuation  of  non-marketable  equity,
securities  may  not  directly  correlate  with  changes  in  valuation  of  marketable  equity  securities. As  of  December  31,
2022  and  2023  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  which  were  accounted  for  under  the,
measurement alternative was 28.5 billion and 28.8 billion respectively.,
The  carrying  values  of  our  equity  method,"investments  which 
totaled  approximately  1.7  billion  as  of"
December 31 2022 and 2023 generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However these investments,
could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.,

Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
