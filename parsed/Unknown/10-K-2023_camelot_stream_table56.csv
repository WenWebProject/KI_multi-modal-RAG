European Commission Fines,
,In 2017 2018 and 2019 the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European
competition  law  and  imposed  fines  of  €2.4  billion  2.7  billion  as  of  June  27  2017  €4.3  billion  5.1  billion  as  of,
June 30 2018 and €1.5 billion 1.7 billion as of March 20 2019 respectively. On September 14 2022 the General,
Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of,
Justice.,
,While each EC decision is under appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
on  our  Consolidated  alance  Sheets  as  we  provided  bank  guarantees  in  lieu  of  a  cash  payment  for  the  fines.  For,
additional information see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual,
Report on Form 10-K.,
Taxes,
,As  of  December  31  2023  we  had  income  taxes  payable  of  4.2  billion  of  which  2.1  billion  was  short-term
"related  to  a  one-time  transition  tax  payable  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs Act  ""Tax Act"".  As",
permitted by the Tax Act we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have,
long-term taxes payable of 6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31 2023.,
Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations,
,As  of  December  31  2023  we  had  material  purchase  commitments  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  45.9
billion of which 31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical,
infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to,
commitments to purchase licenses including content licenses inventory and network capacity. For those agreements,
with variable terms we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as,
of  December  31  2023.  In  certain  instances  the  amount  of  our  contractual  obligations  may  change  based  on  the,
expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses see Note,
10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
,In  addition  we  regularly  enter  into  multi-year  non-cancellable  agreements  to  purchase  renewable  energy  and
energy  attributes  such  as  renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not,include  a  minimum  dollar
commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and,
are not readily determinable.,
Critical Accounting Estimates,
,We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  doing  so  we  have  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions.  Our  critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  involve  a  significant  level  of,
uncertainty  at  the  time  the  estimate  was  made  and  changes  in  them  have  had  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a,
material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly actual results could differ materially from,
our  estimates.  We  base  our  estimates  on  past  experience  and  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable,
under  the  circumstances  and  we  evaluate  these  estimates  on  an  ongoing  basis.  We  have  reviewed  our  critical,
accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our oard of Directors.,
,For  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  the  effect  on  our  financial  statements  see  Note  1  of  the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.,
Fair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities,
,We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our non-
"marketable  equity  securities. These  investments  are  accounted  for  under  the  measurement  alternative  method  ""the",
"measurement alternative"" and are measured at cost less impairment subject to upward and downward adjustments",
resulting  from  observable  price  changes  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer.  These  adjustments,
require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs.,
Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of,
estimates using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.,
,Non-marketable  equity  securities  are  also  evaluated  for  impairment  based  on  qualitative  factors  including  the
"companies' 
financial  and 
liquidity  position  and  access","to  capital  resources  among  others.  When 
indicators  of"
impairment  exist  we  prepare  quantitative  measurements  of  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  investments  using  a  market,
approach  or  an  income  approach  which  requires  judgment  and  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  including  discount,
rates  investee  revenues  and  costs  and  comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies  among  others.,
