other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs respectively based on their other activities on Facebook.
Trends  in  the  number  of  users  affect  our  revenue  and  financial  results  by  influencing  the  number  of  ads  we  are  able  to  show  the  value  of  our  ads  to
marketers  the  volume  of  Payments  transactions  as  well  as  our  expenses  and  capital  expenditures.  Substantially  all  of  our  daily  and  monthly  active  users  as
