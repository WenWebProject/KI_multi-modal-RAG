,"In 2010 Oracle America Inc. ""Oracle"" brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of"
California alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java,
application programming interfaces. After trial final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on,
June 8 2016 and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27 2018 the,
appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29 2018 we filed a petition for a,
rehearing at the Federal Circuit and on August 28 2018 the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24 2019,
we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29 2019 the Supreme Court,
requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27 2019 the Solicitor General,
recommended denying our petition and we provided our response on October 16 2019. On November 15 2019 the,
Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments,
in our case on October 7 2020. If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor the case will be remanded to the,
district court for further determination of the remaining issues in the case including damages if any. We believe this,
lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case we are unable to,
estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any arising from this matter.,
