represent  the  non-cancelable  portion  of  agreements  or  the  minimum  cancellation  fee.  For  those  agreements  with  variable
terms we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31

table above are long-term taxes payable of 2.3 billion as of December 31 2020 primarily related to uncertain tax positions for

due to uncertainties in the timing and outcomes of tax audits.

financial  condition  revenues  or  expenses  results  of  operations 
liquidity  capital  expenditures  or  capital"
resources that is material to investors. See Note 10 included in Part II Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  doing  so  we  have  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  our  reported  amounts  of  assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  gains  and
losses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases we could reasonably have used
different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely
to occur from period to period. Accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that
"there  are  material  differences  between 
these  estimates  and  actual  results  our 
financial  condition  or  results  of"
operations  will  be  affected.  We  base  our  estimates  on  past  experience  and  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are
reasonable  under  the  circumstances  and  we  evaluate  these  estimates  on  an  ongoing  basis.  We  refer  to  accounting
estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below. We have reviewed
our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our oard of Directors.
Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.
