Risks Related to Our usiness and Industry
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business
to other risks.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as
travel  bans and restrictions  limitations  on business activity  quarantines  and shelter-in-place  orders. These measures  have caused and are continuing to cause

2020 or longer and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. While our advertising revenue growth slowed in the first

profitability will be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. In addition to the impact on our advertising business and
operating margin the pandemic exposes our business operations and workforce to a variety of other risks including:
