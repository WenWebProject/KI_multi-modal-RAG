a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on,
Facebook  and  seeking  unspecified  damages  and  injunctive  relief.  The  actions  filed  in  the  United  States  were  consolidated  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the,
Northern  District  of  California.  On  November  26  2019  the  district  court  certified  a  class  for  injunctive  relief  purposes  but  denied  certification  of  a  class  for,
purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16 2020 the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. We believe the remaining lawsuits are,
without merit and we are vigorously defending them. In addition the events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission,
IDPC and other government inquiries.,
,From  time  to  time  we  also  notify  the  IDPC  our  designated  European  privacy  regulator  under  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  of  certain  other
personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. Although we are,
vigorously  defending  our  regulatory  compliance,we  believe  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  the  ultimate  potential  loss  related  to  the  inquiries  and
investigations by the IDPC could be material in the aggregate.,
,In  addition  from  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  litigation  and  other  proceedings  involving  law  enforcement  and  other  regulatory  agencies  including  in
particular  in  razil  and  Europe  in  order  to  ascertain  the  precise  scope  of  our  legal  obligations  to  comply  with  the  requests  of  those  agencies  including  our,
obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.,
We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties and we intend to vigorously defend such fines,
and penalties.,
,With respect to the cases actions and inquiries described above we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we
believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of,
these matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss such losses or range of,
possible  losses  either  cannot  be  estimated  or  are  not  individually  material  but  we  believe  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  they  may  be  material  in  the,
aggregate.,
,We are also party to various other legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course
of  business.  With  respect  to  these  other  matters  we  evaluate  the  associated  developments  on  a  regular  basis  and  accrue  a  liability  when  we  believe  a  loss  is,
probable and the amount can be reasonably  estimated.  In addition we believe  there is a reasonable  possibility  that we may incur a loss in some of these other,
matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not either individually or in the,
aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business and condensed consolidated financial statements.,
,However the outcome of the legal matters described in this section is inherently uncertain. Therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against
us for amounts in excess of management's expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any,
such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected.,
