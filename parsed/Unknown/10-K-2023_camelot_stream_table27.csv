unable  or  fail  to  collect  taxes  on  behalf  of  customers  employees  and  partners  as  the  withholding  agent  we  could,,
become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.,,
,We  are  subject  to  regular  review  and  audit  by  both  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities. As  a  result  we  have,
received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions such,,
as  transfer-pricing  adjustments  or  permanent-establishment  claims. Any  adverse  outcome  of  such  a  review  or  audit,,
could harm our financial condition and operating results require adverse changes to our business practices or subject,,
us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income,,
taxes  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  significant  judgment  and  often  involves  uncertainty.  Although  we  believe  our,,
estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements,,
and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.,,
,Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions,
may  be  subject  to  significant  changes  in  ways  that  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  For,,
example various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital,,
services taxes and other targeted taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax,,
regimes. The  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  OECD  is  coordinating  negotiations  among,,
more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,,
including  the  implementation  of  a  minimum  global  effective  tax  rate  of  15.  Our  effective  tax  rate  and  cash  tax,,
payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.,,
Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock,,
,We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-,
term  stockholder  value  and  share  repurchases  could  increase  the  volatility  of  our  stock  prices  and  could,,
diminish our cash reserves.,,
,We  engage  in  share  repurchases  of  our  Class  A  and  Class  C  stock  from  time  to  time  in  accordance  with,
authorizations from the oard of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and,,
does  not  obligate  Alphabet  to  repurchase  any  specific  dollar  amount  or  to  acquire  any  specific  number  of  shares.,,
Further our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices increase their volatility reduce our cash reserves,,
and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.,,
,The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.,
,Our Class  stock has 10 votes per share our Class A stock has one vote per share and our Class C stock has,
no voting rights. As of December 31 2023 Larry Page and Sergey rin beneficially owned approximately 86.5 of our,,
outstanding  Class    stock  which  represented  approximately  51.5  of  the  voting  power  of  our  outstanding  common,,
"stock.  Through 
their  stock  ownership  Larry  and  Sergey  have  significant",influence  over  all  matters,requiring
stockholder  approval  including  the  election  of  directors  and  significant  corporate  transactions  such  as  a  merger  or,,
other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future. In addition because our Class C stock carries no,,
voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the Class C stock including in future stock-based,,
acquisition  transactions  and  to  fund  employee  equity  incentive  programs  could  continue  Larry  and  Sergey’s  current,,
relative  voting  power  and  their  ability  to  elect  all  of  our  directors  and  to  determine  the  outcome  of  most  matters,,
submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also,,
affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’,,
ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,,
which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.,,
"Provisions 
in  our  charter  documents  and  under  Delaware",law  could  discourage  a,"takeover 
that"
stockholders may consider favorable.,,
,Provisions  in Alphabet’s  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a,
change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:,,
