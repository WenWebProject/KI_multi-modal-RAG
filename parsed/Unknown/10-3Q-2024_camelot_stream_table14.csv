Revenue acklog,,,,,,,,
,As  of  September  30  2024  we  had  86.8  billion  of  remaining  performance  obligations  “revenue  backlog”,,,,,,,
primarily  related  to  Google  Cloud.  Our  revenue  backlog  represents  commitments  in  customer  contracts  for  future,,,,,,,,
services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue.  The  estimated  revenue  backlog  and  timing  of  revenue,,,,,,,,
recognition  for  these  commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant  contract,,,,,,,,
terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog,,,,,,,,
as  revenues  over  the  next  24  months  with  the  remainder  to  be  recognized  thereafter.  Revenue  backlog  includes,,,,,,,,
related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes,,,,,,,,
contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.,,,,,,,,
Deferred Revenues,,,,,,,,
,We  record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance,,,,,,,
including  amounts  which  are,,refundable.  Deferred,,revenues  primarily,relate,to  Google  Cloud  and  Google,,
subscriptions platforms and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31 2023 was 5.0 billion of which,,,,,,,,
3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30 2024.,,,,,,,,
