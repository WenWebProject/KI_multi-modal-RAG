"each  opened  a 
formal 
investigation","into  Google  Playâ€™s  business  practices.  Korean 
regulators  are"
,investigating Google Play's billing practices most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's
compliance with the new app store billing regulations.,
,We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate
with federal and state regulators in the U.S. the EC and other regulators around the world.,
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims,
,We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that
certain  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights. Adverse  results  in,
these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements  or,
orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services. As a result we may have,
to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies which could result in a loss,
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition the U.S. International Trade Commission ITC has,
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC,
action  can  result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing  infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  ecause  the  U.S.  is  an  important,
market  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  including  preventing  us  from  importing,
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.,
,Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  which  would  increase  our  costs  as  a  result  of  defending  such,
claims  and  may  require  that  we  pay  significant  damages  if  there  were  an  adverse  ruling  in  any  such  claims.  In,
addition  our  customers  and  partners  may  discontinue  the  use  of  our  products  services  and  technologies  as  a,
result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.,
Other,
,We  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims  suits  regulatory  and  government  investigations  other  proceedings
"and  consent  decrees 
involving  competition","intellectual  property  privacy  and  cybersecurity 
tax  and 
related"
compliance  labor  and  employment  commercial  disputes  content  generated  by  our  users  goods  and  services,
offered  by  advertisers  or  publishers  using  our  platforms  personal  injury  consumer  protection  and  other  matters.,
For example we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such,
claims  suits  regulatory  and  government  investigations  other  proceedings  and  consent  decrees  could  result  in,
"substantial 
fines  and  penalties","injunctive  relief  ongoing  auditing  and  monitoring  obligations  changes 
to  our"
products  and  services  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or,
other  adverse  consequences  all  of  which  could  harm  our  business  reputation  financial  condition  and  operating,
results.,
,We  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding
penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts including,
those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on,
our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.,
,Certain outstanding matters include speculative substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a
liability  when  we  believe  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably,
estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated  we,
disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount,
of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and,
make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being,
and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.,
,With respect to our outstanding matters based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range
of  reasonably  possible  loss  will  not  either  individually  or  in  aggregate  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our,
business  consolidated  financial  position  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.  However  the  outcome  of  such,
matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.,
