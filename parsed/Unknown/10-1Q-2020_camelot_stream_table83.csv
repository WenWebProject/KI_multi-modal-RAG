In  addition  our  data  regarding  the  geographic  location  of  our  users  is  estimated  based  on  a  number  of  factors  such  as  the  user's  IP  address  and  self-
disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the
location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible
to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.
In addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. All of our
metrics  are  subject  to  software  bugs  inconsistencies  in  our  systems  and  human  error.  If  marketers  developers  or  investors  do  not  perceive  our  metrics  to  be
accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be
less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to Facebook or our other products which could negatively affect our business and financial results.
We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.
Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 48268 as
of March 31 2020 from 37773 as of March 31 2019 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition we plan to continue to
hire a number of employees and contractors in order to address various privacy safety security and content review initiatives. The growth and expansion of our
business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users
marketers  developers  and  other  third  parties.  Additionally  the  vast  majority  of  our  personnel  are  currently  working  remotely  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity. As our operations and the number of our third-party
relationships  continue  to  grow  our  information  technology  systems  or  our  internal  controls  and  procedures  may  not  be  adequate  to  support  such  growth.  In
addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to
manage  such  growth  effectively.  To  effectively  manage  our  growth  we  must  adapt  to  a  remote  work  environment  and  continue  to  improve  our  operational
financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow and we are
required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture
including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.
The loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business.
We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl K. Sandberg. Although we
have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In
addition  many  of  our  key  technologies  and  systems  are  custom-made  for  our  business  by  our  personnel.  The  loss  of  key  personnel  including  members  of
management  as  well  as  key  engineering  product  development  marketing  and  sales  personnel  could  disrupt  our  operations  and  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our
business.
As  we  continue  to  grow  we  cannot  guarantee  we  will  continue  to  attract  and  retain  the  personnel  we  need  to  maintain  our  competitive  position.  In
particular  we  intend  to  continue  to  hire  a  significant  number  of  technical  personnel  in  the  foreseeable  future  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  face  significant
challenges in hiring such personnel particularly in the San Francisco ay Area where our headquarters are located whether as a result of competition with other
companies challenges due to the high cost of living facilities and infrastructure constraints or other factors. As we continue to mature the incentives to attract
retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to
attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our
existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. As a
result  of  these  factors  it  may  be  difficult  for  us  to  continue  to  retain  and  motivate  our  employees.  If  we  do  not  succeed  in  attracting  hiring  and  integrating
excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively.
