,We  also  know  businesses  of  all  sizes  around  the  world  rely  on  Google Ads  to  find  customers  and  grow  their,,,,
businesses — and we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max advertisers simply tell us their campaign,,,,,
goals and share their creative assets and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across,,,,,
all  of  Google’s  properties  to  meet  their  budget.  Product  Studio  brings  the  benefits  of AI  to  businesses  of  all  sizes,,,,,

,uild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices,,,,
,Over the years our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on,,,,
top of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users such as,,,,,
est  Take  Magic  Editor  and  Audio  Magic  Eraser.  As  we  look  ahead  we  are  designing  our  Android  and  Chrome,,,,,
operating systems with new AI-forward user experiences.,,,,,
Moonshots,,,,,
,Many  companies  get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done  making  only  incremental  changes.  This,,,,
incrementalism  leads  to  irrelevance  over  time  especially  in  technology  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary  not,,,,,
evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,,,,,
but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser.,,,,,
Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to,,,,,
future  developments.  We  continue  to  look  toward  the  future  and  to  invest  for  the  long  term  most  notably  for  the,,,,,
application of AI to our products and services as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As,,,,,
we said in the original founders' letter we will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects that we believe in as,,,,,
they are the key to our long-term success.,,,,,
Privacy and Security,,,,,
,We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products users and customers even if there are,,,,
near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;,,,,,
strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that,,,,,
put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time whether by enabling users to auto-delete,,,,,
their  data  giving  them  tools  such  as  My Ad  Center  to  control  their  ad  experience  or  advancing  anti-malware  anti-,,,,,
phishing and password security features.,,,,,
Google,,,,,
,For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.,,,,
Google Services,,,,,
Serving Our Users,,,,,
,We  have  always  been  committed  to  building  helpful  products  that  can  improve  the  lives  of  millions  of  people,,,,
worldwide.  Our  product,innovations  are  what  make  our  services  widely  used  and  our  brand  one  of,,,,the  most
recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads Android Chrome devices Gmail,,,,,
Google Drive Google Maps Google Photos Google Play Search and YouTube with broad and growing adoption by,,,,,
users around the world.,,,,,
,Our  products  and  services  have  come  a  long  way  since  the  company  was  founded  more  than  25  years  ago.,,,,
While  Google  Search  started  as  a  way  to  find  web  pages  organized  into  ten  blue  links  we  have  driven  technical,,,,,
advancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic multimodal experience.,,,,,
We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search making it easier to navigate on smaller,,,,,
screens.  As  new  types  of  content  surfaced  on  the  internet  Universal  Search  made  it  possible  to  search  multiple,,,,,
content  types  like  news  images  videos  and  more  to  deliver  rich  relevant  results. The  introduction  of  new  search,,,,,
modalities  like  voice  and  visual  search  made  it  easier  for  people  to  express  their  curiosity  in  natural  and  intuitive,,,,,
ways. We took that a step further with multisearch which lets people search with text and images at the same time.,,,,,
Large  language  models  like  ERT  and  Multitask  Unified  Models  or  MUMs  have  made  it  possible  to  express  more,,,,,
natural  language  queries  vastly  improving  the  quality  of  results.  Each  advancement  has  made  it  easier  and  more,,,,,
natural for people to find what they are looking for.,,,,,
,This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery,,,,
and  creation  of  digital  content  both  on  the  web  and  through  platforms  like  Google  Play  and  YouTube.  People  are,,,,,
consuming many forms of digital content including watching videos streaming TV playing games listening to music,,,,,
