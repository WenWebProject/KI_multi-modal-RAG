,Non-marketable securities that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current
assets on the Consolidated alance Sheets.,
Derivative Financial Instruments,
See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.,
Accounts Receivable,
,Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or
services  offered.  The  term  between  invoicing  and  when  payment  is  due  is  not  significant.  For  certain  products  or,
services and customers we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.,
,We  maintain  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  accounts  receivable  which  is  recorded  as  an  offset  to  accounts
receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements,
of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics,
exist  and  on  an  individual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or  collectibility  issues.  In,
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status,
and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider,
customer-specific  information  current  market  conditions  such  as  the  effects  caused  by  COVID-19  and  reasonable,
and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.,
,The  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  accounts  receivable  was  789  million  and  550  million  as  of  December  31
2020 and 2021 respectively.,
Other,
,Our  financial  instruments  also  include  debt  and  equity  investments  in  companies  with  which  we  also  have
commercial arrangements. For these transactions judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements,
such as the market value of similar transactions or the fair value of the investment based on stand-alone transactions,
and whether the agreements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP.,
Impairment of Investments,
We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.,
,For  debt  securities  in  an  unrealized  loss  position  we  determine  whether  a  credit  loss  exists.  The  credit  loss  is
estimated  by  considering  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectibility  of  the  security  and  information  about  past,
events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other,
income expense net not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss,
are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI. If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely,
than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized,
cost  basis  we  will  write  down  the  security  to  its  fair  value  and  record  the  corresponding  charge  as  a  component  of,
other income expense net.,
,For  non-marketable  equity  securities  including  equity  method  investments  we  consider  whether  impairment
indicators  exist  by  evaluating  the  companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  and  access  to  capital  resources  among,
other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair,
value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net. We prepare quantitative,
measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.,
Inventory,
,Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is
computed using the first-in first-out method.,
Variable Interest Entities,
,We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in
which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE. We consolidate VIEs when we are,
the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most,
significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or,
benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a,
VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.,
,Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination
of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary.,
